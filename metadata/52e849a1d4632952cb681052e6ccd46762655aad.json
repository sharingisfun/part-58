You play Prof. Liebwerk the head physician of the Lovecraftian Arkham Sanatorium. Your task is to complete your journal with all the stories from the crazy inmates. But before they will tell you anything you have to win their trust.\r\n\r\nDuring the night you will be haunted by terrible nightmares. Try to avoid those horrors or they will drive you insane. On the other hand... a little insanity might help to convince the patients to tell their stories","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52e849a1d4632952cb681052e6ccd46762655aad","amp;dn":"Arkham+Nightmares","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52e849a1d4632952cb681052e6ccd46762655aad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,232,73,161,212,99,41,82,203,104,16,82,230,204,212,103,98,101,90,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
