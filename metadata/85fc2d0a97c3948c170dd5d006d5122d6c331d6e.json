Anthony had to endure an abusive, alcoholic father but was blessed with a nurturing, hardworking mother whom he loses at a very early age. In spite of the odds, he struggles to uphold the morals his Mother taught him and retain his dignity. Anthony is taken under the wing of a local mob boss, Enzo DeVino (Michael Madsen), who along with his boss Gino (Alec Baldwin) supports Anthony's wish to escape his demons through the sport of boxing. Enzo unites Anthony with a trainer, Eddie â€œRocksâ€ Trevor (Danny Glover), who turns Anthony into a contender. As Anthony journeys into adulthood with the nearly impossible goal of achieving a successful professional boxing career, he manages to not only go pro, but to fight his way to the Middleweight championship. Love and loss, humiliation and retaliation all play major roles in his journey, but when he finally makes it to the top he realizes that the real fight was outside the ring.\r\n\r\nDirector: Paul Borghese\r\n\r\nWriters: William Demeo\r\n\r\nActors: William Demeo, Michael Madsen, Alec Baldwin, Annabella Sciorra, Mike Tyson, Shannen Doherty, Danny Glover\r\n\r\nGenre: Drama\r\n\r\nRun Time: 2 hours\r\n\r\nStudio: Â© 2016 Abramorama","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85fc2d0a97c3948c170dd5d006d5122d6c331d6e","amp;dn":"Back+in+the+Day.+Official+Movie+Trailer+%231+%5BHD%5D+%282016%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85fc2d0a97c3948c170dd5d006d5122d6c331d6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,252,45,10,151,195,148,140,23,13,213,208,6,213,18,45,108,51,29,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
