He then recalled that his life could actually have been much better if he had made better choices in the past.\r\n\r\nJust when he was at the point of regret, he saw a truck moving at fast speed, and three high schoolers in its path. Mustering all the strength he had, he tried to save them and ended getting run over by the truck, quickly ending his life.\r\n\r\nThe next time he opened his eyes, he is reincarnated to a world of sword and magic as Rudeus Greyrat. Born to a new world, a new life, Rudeus decided that, &quot;This time, I'll really live my life to the fullest with no regret!&quot; Thus starts the journey of a man yearning to restart his life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3f8a70326da21e80a2272af2db194d2ae484338","amp;dn":"Mushoku+Tensei+Volume+1+-+24+%28English%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3f8a70326da21e80a2272af2db194d2ae484338","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,248,167,3,38,218,33,232,10,34,114,175,45,177,148,210,174,72,67,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
