Our panel, on average, had Trump garnering 513 pledged delegates after the March 15 primaries, to add to the 694 he had already won.2 In that scenario, Trump would fall just short of 1,237, but heâ€™d be close enough that he could still win the nomination on the first ballot at the GOP convention by securing the support of some of the 100+ unpledged delegates.\r\n \nhttp://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-made-a-mistake-by-overlooking-colorado/\r\n\r\n____________\r\n\r\nâ€œSaudi Arabia transferred Tiran and Sanafir to Egyptian control in 1950 amid concerns that Israel might seize them. The announcement elicited vivid protests from Egyptians who have for decades considered the islands to be Egyptian land. And it set off a debate over whether President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi had made a humiliating concession to a wealthy ally. In a flood of social media posts, critics called Mr. Sisi â€œAwaad,â€ referring to a character in an old Egyptian song who had sold his land â€” a shameful act in the eyes of rural Egyptians. â€œThe island is for a billion, the pyramids are for two, and they come with two gift statues on top,â€ the satirist Bassem Youssef wrote on Twitter. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/11/world/middleeast/egypt-gives-saudi-arabia-2-islands-in-a-show-of-gratitude.html?_r=2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:619339ceacd6534e9914ec838d023b3270f60c5b","amp;dn":"john-batchelor-big-data-sweeps-co-post-american-middle-east.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"619339ceacd6534e9914ec838d023b3270f60c5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,147,57,206,172,214,83,78,153,20,236,131,141,2,59,50,112,246,12,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
