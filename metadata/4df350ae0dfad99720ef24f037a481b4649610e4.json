Co-host Malcolm Hoenlein, Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations. Thaddeus McCotter, WJR.\r\n\r\nThe indictment came hours after the Israeli military said it had discovered and destroyed a tunnel from Gaza into Israel â€” the first one to be discovered since Israel's 2014 war with Gaza's ruling Islamic militant Hamas movement.\r\n\r\nIsraeli troops detected the tunnel's exit several days ago, according to military spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, who said the tunnel is believed to have been built after the war. It stretched several hundred meters (yards), was lined with cement and outfitted with electricity, ventilation and rail tracks to cart away dirt from digging, he said.\r\n\r\nIn the 2014 war, Israel destroyed more than 30 Hamas tunnels under the border.\r\n\r\nHamas has vowed to rebuild the tunnel network. This year, 14 people died in Gaza while digging tunnels aimed at attacking Israelis or hiding weapons and rocket launch sites, and Israeli officials estimate there are 800 Gazans working as diggers.\r\n\r\nIsraelis living near the Gaza Strip have reported hearing digging sounds under their homes in recent months.\r\n\r\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has achieved a &quot;global breakthrough in the ability to locate tunnels,&quot; and the government was investing considerable capital in countering the threat.\r\n\r\n&quot;This is an ongoing effort that will not end overnight,&quot; he said.\r\n\r\nThe Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, said the newly discovered and destroyed tunnel was &quot;just a drop in the ocean of what the resistance has prepared to defend its people, free its sanctuaries and prisoners.&quot;\r\n \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/04/18/world/middleeast/ap-ml-israel-palestinians.html?ref=middleeast&amp;_r=1\r\n\r\nJERUSALEM (JTA) â€” A UNESCO resolution does not recognize a Jewish connection to the Western Wall and the Temple Mount and calls Israel an â€œoccupying power.â€\r\n\r\nThe resolution was adopted Friday by the executive board of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization resolution at a meeting in Paris.\r\n\r\nSix months after the organization decided not to classify the Western Wall as a solely Muslim site, the measure refers to the Western Wall as Al-Buraq Plaza and to the Temple Mount as the Al-Aksa Mosque/Al-Haram Al Sharif.\r\n\r\nThe resolution, which condemns Israeli actions in eastern Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza Strip, accuses Israel of being an â€œoccupying power,â€ of â€œplanting Jewish fake graves in other spaces of the Muslim cemeteriesâ€ and of â€œthe continued conversion of many Islamic and Byzantine remains into the so-called Jewish ritual baths or into Jewish prayer places,â€ according to Israeli newspaper reports.\r\n \nhttp://www.jta.org/2016/04/17/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/unesco-resolution-ignores-jewish-ties-to-temple-mount-western-wall\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4df350ae0dfad99720ef24f037a481b4649610e4","amp;dn":"John-Batchelor-return-of-terror-tunnels-of-gaza.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4df350ae0dfad99720ef24f037a481b4649610e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,243,80,174,13,250,217,151,32,239,36,240,55,164,129,180,100,150,16,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
