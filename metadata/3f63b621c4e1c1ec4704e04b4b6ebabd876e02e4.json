RELEASE.DATE .. PROTECTION .......: Steam\r\n Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 1 :.......... DISC(S) .. GAME.TYPE ........: Action\r\n\r\n Â Terror. Violence. Madness. Bedlam. A holiday paradise gone mad. A tropical\r\n Â island turns into total chaos after a mysterious zombie outbreak. Cut off\r\n Â from the rest of the world, the player's only chance to survive is to fight\r\n Â to the death and find a way to escape from the island.\r\n\r\n Â Dead Island combines first-person action with a heavy focus on melee combat,\r\n Â character development and customization of a vast array of weapons. All of\r\n Â these gameplay features are presented in a dark story inspired by classic\r\n Â zombie movies with a gritty and engrossing campaign that can be played with\r\n Â up to four players in co-op mode.\r\n\r\n Â Set in an open world tropical island, hordes of different festering zombies\r\n Â await players around every corner while they embark on a variety of\r\n Â thrilling missions through the holiday resort. With firearms and ammunition\r\n Â being scarce the player must rely on utilizing found items as weapons for\r\n Â self-defense and fight off zombie hordes in intense melee combat. A diverse\r\n Â range of items can be collected and will later serve to transform the\r\n Â player's ordinary makeshift weapons into serious instruments of destruction.\r\n\r\n Â In addition to satisfying even the most bloodthirsty action fan's fantasy,\r\n Â Dead Island also features role-playing elements which allow the player to\r\n Â develop one of the game's unique character classes according to their\r\n Â preferences, all the while learning new skills and fresh tactics during\r\n Â their journey through the perilous environments of the island. What's more,\r\n Â anytime during a game up to four players can seamlessly join together and\r\n Â experience the intense combat and immersive story with cooperative gameplay.\r\n\r\n Â With the all-new Chrome Engine 5 powering Dead Island, the game will use the\r\n Â latest installment of Techland's acclaimed proprietary game engine, allowing\r\n Â the player to experience the tropical island paradise in graphical splendor\r\n Â with diverse environments like lush forests and detailed city environments.\r\n\r\n Â 1.
