Gene Marks, WashingtonPost.com.\r\n\r\nBut even assuming that the Tax Foundationâ€™s numbers come to pass, thereâ€™s still too much information missing to determine who has the best tax plan. Yes, weâ€™ve heard about the revenues. But what about the expenses? Iâ€™ve never read a profit and loss statement with only revenues included. So whereâ€™s my complete P&amp;L?\r\n\r\nWhen anyone in business proposes a change to their companyâ€™s business - a big investment, a new product line, a change in model â€“ there are projections. We donâ€™t just budget the good stuff (the hoped-for revenues) but we also include the not-so-good stuff (the costs). Politicians are experts at highlighting the â€œgoodâ€ and downplaying the â€œbad.â€\r\n\r\nTax decreases are good. But a $19 trillion national debt and projected trillion dollar deficits over the next decade are bad. Saying that youâ€™re going to â€œclean up governmentâ€ and â€œget rid of wasteâ€ isnâ€™t good enough. Business people need more information than that. We like to know both sides of the story: the revenue coming in and the costs going out. Just because Clintonâ€™s and Sandersâ€™ plans will increase revenues to the government over the next 10 years, what exactly will they be spending? And if Cruzâ€™s and Trumpâ€™s plans are going to create a hole in Federal revenue inlays, where will the expenses be correspondingly reduced?\r\n\r\nThe one big thing missing from the candidates' tax proposals\r\n \nhttp://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2016/04/11/one-big-thing-missing-from-candidates-tax-proposals.html\r\n\r\nHomebuilder Confidence Unchanged in April\r\n \nhttp://feedproxy.google.com/%7Er/typepad/RyNm/%7E3/yTliCo0llzA/\r\n\r\nManufacturers Continue to Lead on Employee Benefits\r\n \nhttp://www.shopfloor.org/2016/04/manufacturers-continue-to-lead-on-employee-benefits/\r\n\r\nshopfloor.org\r\n\r\nJetBlue is going to pay its employees' college tuition upfront\r\n \nhttp://theweek.com/speedreads/619134/jetblue-going-pay-employees-college-tuition-upfront\r\n \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-small-business/wp/2016/04/18/gene-marks-why-small-businesses-are-not-feeling-so-sunny-these-days-just-do-the-math/\r\n\r\nOne of the nationâ€™s largest pension funds could soon cut benefits for retirees\r\n\r\n\r\nAre You Happy At Work?
