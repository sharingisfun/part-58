Youâ€™re allowed to dance, in case you didnâ€™t know, andâ€¦uh, thatâ€™s about it. This is called â€˜Waiting for the Man,â€™ a tender folk song from the early â€™50s about love between man and subway, and Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll all enjoy it.â€\r\n\r\nThe preceding words were selected by Lou Reed as his opening salvo when the Velvet Underground took the stage of Maxâ€™s Kansas City in New York City on August 23, 1970â€¦ and, in turn, they were the words that the bandâ€™s fans heard within seconds of putting on Side One of the Velvet Undergroundâ€™s first live album, Live at Maxâ€™s Kansas City, which was released 42 years ago today.\r\n\r\nAlthough itâ€™s certainly an enjoyable enough listen for fans, particularly those who never actually got to experience a Velvet Underground concert for themselves, itâ€™s always a little disappointing to recall that its release really only came about because Atlantic Records had no faith in the bandâ€™s chances of becoming a commercial success and didnâ€™t want to invest the time or money in the recording of a new studio album. \r\n\r\nIn the labelâ€™s defense, though, theyâ€™d just watched Reed â€“ the last songwriter left standing from the original V.U. lineup â€“ depart the ranks, leaving Doug Yule as the driving force of the bandâ€¦and if youâ€™ve ever heard Squeeze, then you know Atlantic made the right decision.\r\n\r\nGiven that the show took place as the band were in the final stages of finishing the Loaded album, itâ€™s no surprise that the set list is somewhat heavy on songs from that particular record, including â€œSweet Jane,â€ â€œLonesome Cowboy Bill,â€ â€œNew Age,â€ and â€œWho Loves the Sun,â€ itâ€™s filled with plenty of earlier classics, including the aforementioned â€œIâ€™m Waiting for the Manâ€ as well as â€œWhite Light / White Heat,â€ â€œIâ€™ll Be Your Mirror,â€ â€œPale Blue Eyes,â€ â€œSunday Morning,â€ and â€œFemme Fatale.â€ The original release of the album featured a pared-down and re-sequenced version of the performance, with Reed teaming with producer Geoff Haslam to create a loud side and a quiet side, but â€“ ahem! â€“ when Rhino reissued the album in 2004, we took both of the bandâ€™s sets from that evening, put them in their original running order, and released the whole thing as a 2-disc deluxe edition.\r\n\r\nGranted, the fact that the proceedings were recorded on cassette â€“ with Jim Carroll handling the microphone, no less â€“ means that itâ€™s always going to sound a little more â€œrealâ€ than some listeners might prefer from their live-album purchases, but, câ€™mon, itâ€™s the Velvet Underground: if you canâ€™t handle the sound getting a little raw and unkempt at times, youâ€™re in the wrong place, anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecorded live at Max's Kansas City, New York. On August 23, 1970 by Brigid Polk on a portable cassette recorder.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - I'm Waiting for the Man\r\n02 - White Light-White Heat\r\n03 - I'm Set Free\r\n04 - Sweet Jane\r\n05 - Lonesome Cowboy Bill\r\n06 - New Age\r\n07 - Beginning to See the Light\r\n08 - I'll Be Your Mirror\r\n09 - Pale Blue Eyes\r\n10 - Candy Says\r\n11 - Sunday Morning\r\n12 - After Hours\r\n13 - Femme Fatale\r\n14 - Some Kinda Love\r\n15 - Lonesome Cowboy Bill (version 2)\r\n\r\n*2015, 2016 Cotillion / Atlantic / Rhino / Warner | 081227950736\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nLou Reed: rhythm guitar &amp; lead vocals\r\nSterling Morrison: lead &amp; rhythm guitars\r\nDoug Yule: bass &amp; vocals\r\nBill Yule: drums\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and Sharing, Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLou Reed - New Sensations (1984) [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7197794/Lou_Reed_-_New_Sensations_%281984%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLou Reed - Take No Prisoners (1978) Live 2 CD [EAC-FLAC]:\r\n \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7201247/Lou_Reed_-_Take_No_Prisoners_%281978%29_Live_2_CD_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLou Reed - Berlin.
