The band has undergone many lineup changes through the years, the current lineup \r\n\r\nconsisting of Damian Scott (Vocals), Jeremy Caldwell (Guitars), Mike Lindenmuth (Guitars), Darby Salter \r\n\r\n(Bass), and Mike Shaw (Drums).\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nImpurity has shared the stage with well-known acts such as Deicide, Amon Amarth, Malevolent\r\n\r\nCreation, and many others. The band has had extensive experience with live performances for more than a decade.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs of 2014, the band has released 2 EPs, 1 LP, and 1 Promo, and is set to release a second full-length in \r\n\r\nthe coming months. The release details are as follows:\r\n\r\nSubjugation of Mankind (1999 EP, Self-Released)\r\n\r\nUnearthly Affinity (2003 EP, Nuclear Winter Records)\r\n\r\nOf Lust and War (2007 LP, Butchered Records)\r\n\r\nPromo 2009 (3-Song Promo, Self-Released)\r\n\r\nReign or Ruin (2014 LP, Coming Soon)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRECENT ACTIVITY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn early 2012, the band tracked drums and guitars at Diet of Worms Studios. After spending a day in the \r\n\r\nstudio, Shaw and Scott took the material to Shaw's home-based studio and collaborated on the project's \r\n\r\nvarious stages. The work done in Shaw's studio entailed recording the vocals &amp; bass guitar for all of \r\n\r\nthe songs, and with assistance from Scott, Shaw then completed the mixing and mastering processes, \r\n\r\neffectively completing the project in October of 2014. During this time, Justin Wood, who had handled \r\n\r\ndrum duties on the recording, parted ways with the band and was replaced by Shaw, who had recorded \r\n\r\nbass guitars for the release.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCOMING SOON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSet for release in late 2014, the band's second full-length album &quot;Reign or Ruin&quot; promises to serve as a \r\n\r\nfoul treat from this long-standing Florida death metal powerhouse. Fans of death metal's early days are \r\n\r\nsure to be quite pleased by this latest offering, which cleverly combines elements found in both the new \r\n\r\nand old school death metal styles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4edb943f5dc2872a8b3981416e69c87dfe141026","amp;dn":"Impurity+Discography+%281998-2009%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4edb943f5dc2872a8b3981416e69c87dfe141026","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,219,148,63,93,194,135,42,139,57,129,65,110,105,200,125,254,20,16,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
