It quickly became the band's best selling album, though was later surpassed by Fear of a Blank Planet. The album is based on a screenplay written by Steven Wilson and Mike Bennion, and is essentially a ghost story.\r\n\r\nI snatched the discography from this site and noticed the volume cuts out quite badly on Deadwing.. I bought the disc myself and uploaded it. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be1c577431269a01fdadea5e22b775907685123b","amp;dn":"Porcupine+Tree+-+Deadwing+%28MP3+%40+320+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be1c577431269a01fdadea5e22b775907685123b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,28,87,116,49,38,154,1,253,173,234,94,34,183,117,144,118,133,18,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
