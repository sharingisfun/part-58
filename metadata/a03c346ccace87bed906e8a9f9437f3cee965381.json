Guarded by a zealous warrior knighthood of continental renown, the omnipotent evil of the Coda Uma has rested hidden and reviled since the Twilight. He involves his best friend Sefalin, black sheep and first prince of Rowender. \r\n\r\nSefalin has made errors and raised ire before, but not like this. As for Azaroth, he made no plans for the eruption of catastrophies their misguided meddling unleashes.\r\nExhausted, hunted relentlessly from all sides, separated and scattered across a riven world, can they steal again what they want to be rid of while evading their enemies (everyone), and if they can, where can they hide what wants to be found and cannot be concealed?\r\n\r\nAn account of love that endures, friendship that transcends and an apocalypse that will reveal the greatest casualty of all","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a03c346ccace87bed906e8a9f9437f3cee965381","amp;dn":"Azaroth%26amp%3BSefalin_torr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a03c346ccace87bed906e8a9f9437f3cee965381","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,60,52,108,202,206,135,190,217,6,232,169,249,67,127,60,238,150,83,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
