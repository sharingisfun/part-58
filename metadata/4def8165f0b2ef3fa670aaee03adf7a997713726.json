It is an ice wonderland, full of people braving the cold, diving into frozen water and enjoying themselves at minus 30 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe three of them also experience the New Year transport rush and crush in Beijing, following an Anglo-Chinese family back to China, joining the crush at Beijing's West Station and battling through Beijing traffic.\r\n\r\n2016 is the year of the monkey, and Kate goes in search of the extremely rare snub-nosed monkeys of Yunnan. She goes on a poo hunt, looking for monkey faeces to test for their health. Jing experiences the spectacular showers of sparks from ancient fireworks made from molten metal by Mr Xue, the last practitioner of this dying craft, whose only protection is a sheepskin coat and a straw hat. Ant finds out how an entire ice city is made from just frozen river water, sculpted to make full-sized buildings that are illuminated beautifully at night.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Hairy Bikers Dave and Si join the largest motorbike flotilla on earth as thousands of migrant workers in Guangdong province head for home as New Year approaches - it is an extraordinary scene as workers from the city go back to their home villages, often for the only time in a year. The Bikers join the volunteers helping the motorcyclists as they head carefully back home on bikes loaded high with people and presents.\r\n\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFile size : 1 007 MiB\r\nDuration : 59mn 9s\r\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\r\nOverall bit rate : 2 379 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nMaximum bit rate : 3 500 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nCompression mode : Lossy\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nText\r\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4def8165f0b2ef3fa670aaee03adf7a997713726","amp;dn":"BBC+Chinese+New+Year+Biggest+Celebration+on+Earth+1of3+Migration","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4def8165f0b2ef3fa670aaee03adf7a997713726","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,239,129,101,240,178,239,63,166,112,170,238,3,173,247,169,151,113,55,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
