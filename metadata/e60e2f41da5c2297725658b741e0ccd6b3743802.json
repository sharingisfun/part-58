Muchael Vlahos, Johns Hopkins.\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦Obama hosted more than 50 world leaders for his fourth and final summit focused on efforts to lock down atomic materials to guard against nuclear terrorism, which he called &quot;one of the greatest threats to global security&quot; in the 21st century.\r\n\r\nObama has less than 10 months left in office to follow through on one of his signature foreign policy initiatives. While gains have been made, arms-control advocates say the diplomatic process â€“ which Obama conceived and championed - has lost momentum and could slow further once he leaves the White House in January.\r\n\r\nâ€œA boycott by Russian President Vladimir Putin, unwilling to join in a U.S.-dominated gathering at a time of increased tensions between Washington and Moscow over Ukraine and Syria, may have contributed to summit results marked by mostly technical measures instead of policy breakthroughsâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-nuclear-summit-obama-treaty-idUSKCN0WY52M\r\n \nhttp://www.nss2016.org\r\n\r\nThe Washington Naval Treaty, also known as the Five-Power Treaty, and including the &quot;Four-Power Treaty&quot; and the &quot;Nine-power Treaty&quot; was a treaty among the major nations that had won World War I, which agreed to prevent an arms race by limiting naval construction. It was negotiated at the Washington Naval Conference, held in Washington, D.C., from November 1921 to February 1922, and it was signed by the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy. It limited the construction of battleships, battlecruisers and aircraft carriers by the signatories. The numbers of other categories of warships, including cruisers, destroyers and submarines, were not limited by the treaty, but those ships were limited to 10,000 tons displacement.\r\n\r\n&quot;The naval treaty was concluded on February 6, 1922. Ratifications of that treaty were exchanged in Washington on August 17, 1923, and it was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on April 16, 1924.[1]\r\n\r\n&quot;Subsequent to the treaty, other naval arms limitation conferences sought to increase limitations of warship building. The terms of the Washington treaty were modified by the London Naval Treaty of 1930 and the Second London Naval Treaty of 1936. By the mid-1930s, Japan and Italy renounced the treaties, making naval arms limitation an increasingly untenable position for the other signatories.\r\n \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Naval_Treaty","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e60e2f41da5c2297725658b741e0ccd6b3743802","amp;dn":"johnbatchelor-nuclear-weapon-summitry-harbinger-war.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e60e2f41da5c2297725658b741e0ccd6b3743802","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,14,47,65,218,92,34,151,114,86,88,183,65,224,204,214,179,116,56,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
