Netanyahu in Moscow. Malcolm Hoenlein, @conf_of_pres. John Bolton, AEI. @annaborsh, WI. Irwin Cotler, Raoul Wallenberg Center\r\n\r\nâ€¦Fundamental strategic misconceptions underlie Mr. Obamaâ€™s Middle East actions, including that America should be essentially neutral in the regionâ€™s great conflicts; our efforts, over decades, to protect our interests and allies have reduced, not enhanced, peace and security; and a detached, minimalist U.S. role henceforth will permit local actors, without our meddling, to reach their own accommodations more readily. These precepts have caused innumerable foreign policy blunders, including Mr. Obamaâ€™s sustained maltreatment of Israel, the Iran nuclear deal, and the failure to suppress the Islamic State (ISIS) and other terrorist threats.\r\n\r\nSo stated, the basic isolationism of Mr. Obamaâ€™s strategy becomes clear, ironically similar to that advocated this year by several presidential candidates. Describing Saudi Arabia and other Arab friends as â€œfree ridersâ€ was both revealing and far from casual, as was the presidentâ€™s previous sneering dismissal of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Obama has implemented his approach as rigorously as possible, albeit sometimes deflected by domestic political calculations or bureaucratic forces, particularly the Pentagon, whose institutional culture never accepted his worldview.\r\n\r\nâ€œBut these are simply exceptions from Mr. Obamaâ€™s grand strategy, not examples of his core beliefs. And his persistence means that it will not suffice for a new president just to reverse this or that individual policy. Russiaâ€™s air base at Latakia is but one concrete example on an unfortunately long list of such durable adverse consequences that merely changing policies cannot eraseâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.aei.org/publication/americas-middle-east-policy-post-obama/\r\n \nhttp://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-maturing-of-israeli-russian-relations\r\n\r\nâ€¢ http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/after-the-pullout-putins-military-options-in-syria\r\n\r\nâ€¢ http://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-heads-to-moscow-for-talks-on-syria/\r\n\r\n____________\r\n\r\nJNS.org â€“ A 3,200 year-old Egyptian amulet was recently discovered by a 12-year-old Jewish girl who was volunteering at the Temple Mount Sifting Project in Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhile I was sifting, I came across a piece of pottery that was different from others I had seen, and I immediately thought that maybe I had found something special,â€ said Neshama Spielman.\r\n\r\nâ€œItâ€™s amazing to find something thousands of years old from ancient Egypt all the way here in Jerusalem! Celebrating Passover this year is going to be extra meaningful to me.â€\r\n\r\nThe amulet displays the name of Thutmose III, the pharaoh of Egyptâ€™s 18th Dynasty, who reigned from 1479-1425 BCE, according to the Ir David Foundation. The foundation co-sponsors the Temple Mount Sifting Project, in which volunteers sift through debris removed from the holy site and to try to retrieve as many artifacts as possible.\r\n \nhttp://www.algemeiner.com/2016/04/19/ancient-egyptian-amulet-discovered-by-12-year-old-girl-in-jerusalem/\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6658063ad404bf92f8cde533afe7e832777546a4","amp;dn":"Obama-in-Arabia-Netanyahu-Moscow.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6658063ad404bf92f8cde533afe7e832777546a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,88,6,58,212,4,191,146,248,205,229,51,175,231,232,50,119,117,70,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
