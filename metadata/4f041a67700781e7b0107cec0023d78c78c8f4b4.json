There are no better quality rips of Futurama out there.  These are all hevc h.265.  All original audio and subtitle tracks have been included.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Bender's Big Score, there is a 1080p TV rip out there.  I chose not to include it because it is edited, and is missing several funny moments.  The DVD rip is the definitive edition, unless and until a blu ray is released.\r\n\r\nBeast With A Billion Backs is a DVD rip, the only format in which it was released.\r\n\r\nBender's Game and Into the Wild Green Yonder are both blu ray rips.\r\n\r\nThis was all encoded in handbrake with some custom settings.  I'm not a release group, just a man with a computer and a love of Futurama.  The series is available here: https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/14256923","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f041a67700781e7b0107cec0023d78c78c8f4b4","amp;dn":"Futurama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f041a67700781e7b0107cec0023d78c78c8f4b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,4,26,103,112,7,129,231,176,16,124,236,0,35,215,140,120,200,244,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
