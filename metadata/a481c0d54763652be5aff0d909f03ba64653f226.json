The addition of\r\nmulti-instrumentalist Glen Hall to the now longstanding (although not often\r\ngigging) duo brings a lot of focus to the music. His saxes, flutes, clarinets,\r\nand hand-held percussion instruments often take the lead seat, drawing up moods\r\nfor Ranaldo and Hooker to paint with their guitar loops and frantic\r\ndrumming. The nine free improvisations herein are at times raucous like the\r\nbest free jazz, gloomy like a film noir soundtrack, or simply Ranaldo-esque in\r\ntheir starkness (yes, the man does get to lead the way once in a while). No\r\npoetry this time, but you will hear much shouting (Hall?) and occasional voices\r\ntrapped in Ranaldo's audio collages. The 16-minute &quot;Conference Call&quot; features\r\nsuch a collage, with unrelated snippets of telephone conversations\r\ncrisscrossing each other. The improvisation these voices underpin is\r\nparticularly strong, but the collage gets tiresome early on and will keep\r\nlooping until the very end of the track. &quot;The Mechanism&quot; and &quot;View from\r\nBellevue&quot; provide other highlights, Hooker's tom-tom-heavy drumming style\r\npropelling the trio. Hall made some questionable choices when he edited the\r\ntapes, some tracks cutting abruptly in mid-fade-out, but that is nothing\r\ncompared to Ranaldo's post-recording treatments on Clouds. Still, one wonders\r\nwhy he felt the need to cut up long improvisations into smaller chunks. At\r\nleast, Oasis of Whispers retains the urgency of the live performance, recorded\r\nin September 2001, when urgency rang true.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Adam Strohm \nhttp://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/2884\r\n\r\nBy Nic Jones \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/oasis-of-whispers-alien8-recordings-review-by-nic-jones.php\r\n\r\nBy Dan Warburton \nhttp://www.paristransatlantic.com/magazine/monthly2006/02feb_text.html#8\r\n\r\nBy Martin BÃ¼sser (de) \nhttp://www.intro.de/popmusik/glenn-hall-lee-ranaldo-william-hooker\r\n\r\nPar Guillaume Belhomme (fr)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a481c0d54763652be5aff0d909f03ba64653f226","amp;dn":"Hall%2C+Ranaldo%2C+Hooker+-+Oasis+Of+Whispers+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a481c0d54763652be5aff0d909f03ba64653f226","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,129,192,213,71,99,101,43,229,175,240,217,9,240,59,166,70,83,242,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
