But there are things in our prehistory â€œabout which we do not have the faintest idea,â€ writes best-selling author Erich von Dniken in his gripping new book, Remnants of the Gods. Stone structures erected by master builders, mysterious underground complexes, geometrically aligned stone circles, the breathtaking pyramids of Egyptâ€“who built them? And, perhaps more importantly, where did these builders obtain such incredible knowledge? Erich von Dniken shows in detail how whole countries were surveyed thousands of years ago. Hundreds of Stone Age holy places are located at equal distances from one another, forming giant squares and triangles. How was all of this possible? Classic archaeology provides no answers to these questions. Worse still, it doesnâ€™t even appear to be interested. Are we all threatening to become â€œcamp followers of disinterest,â€ as Erich asks? Featuring more than 160 color photos and illustrations, Erich reveals the secrets of â€œimpossible buildingsâ€ in Europe and the Mediterranean region, describes â€œcrazy facts,â€ and relentlessly exposes false doctrines. Remnants of the Gods will make even strident skeptics reconsider what they think they know of the past.\r\n\r\n**************************************************************\r\nVisit us for more Awesome, First time on net &amp; Retail ebooks @ \r\n**************************************************************\r\n \nhttp://booksdeity.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bf9ca131acde2a2b3ff74e01ce8fefea519fe94","amp;dn":"Remnants+of+the+Gods+by+Erich+von+Daniken.epub+%7BBDteam%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bf9ca131acde2a2b3ff74e01ce8fefea519fe94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,249,202,19,26,205,226,162,179,255,116,224,28,232,254,254,165,25,254,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
