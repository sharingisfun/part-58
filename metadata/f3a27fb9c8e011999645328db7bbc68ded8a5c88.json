Brian begins to accustom himself to life as a father, while Dom tries to help Letty Ortiz regain her memories. Meanwhile, Owen's older brother, Deckard Shaw, breaks into the secure hospital the comatose Owen is being held in and swears vengeance against Dom, before breaking into Luke Hobbs' DSS office to extract profiles of Dom's crew. After revealing his identity, Shaw engages Hobbs in a fight, and escapes when he detonates a bomb that severely injures Hobbs. Dom later learns from his sister Mia that she is pregnant again and convinces her to tell Brian. However, a bomb, disguised in a package sent from Tokyo, explodes and destroys the Toretto house just seconds after Han, a member of their team, is killed by Shaw in Tokyo. Dom later visits Hobbs in a hospital, where he learns that Shaw is a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his brother. Dom then travels to Tokyo to claim Han's body, and meets and races Sean Boswell, a friend of Han's who gives him personal items found at Han's crash site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Info\r\n\r\nCompression: No\r\nMovie Quality: DVD9\r\nSize: 7698 Mb\r\nLanguages: English, Italian, French, Hindi Ac3 5.1 (English Descriptive Service)\r\nSubtitles: English, Italian, French, Hindi, Portuguese, Arabic, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian, Swedish\r\nColors\r\nRuntime: 131 min.\r\nMenu:Yes\r\nExtra: Back To the Starting Line\r\n\r\n\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2820852/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3a27fb9c8e011999645328db7bbc68ded8a5c88","amp;dn":"Fast+%26amp%3B+Furious+7+%282014%29+%5BDVD9+-+Mltilang+5.1+-+Multisubs%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3a27fb9c8e011999645328db7bbc68ded8a5c88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,162,127,185,200,224,17,153,150,69,50,141,183,187,198,141,237,138,92,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
