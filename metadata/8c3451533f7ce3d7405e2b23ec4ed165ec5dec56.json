Although Nazareth had his suspicions about possible effects of the World War I, and he was considering the possibility of non-Muslim minorities of the Ottoman Empire being conscripted to fight in the army, his family and friends were trying to be optimistic, although they heard stories of disappearing men from different villages. One night, Ottoman soldiers came to his door and took him to work for the army at a road construction, which is basically in the middle of an uninhabited area. While he was working there and as time passed by, he and his friends started to notice different groups of passer-by Armenians, under arrest. They even witnessed a rape. At one point, an Ottoman officer came to their camp and asked them if they would accept to convert to Islam. Some did and some did not. The officer and his fellows took the converts and left. Some soldiers and convicts, recruited solely to kill Armenians, arrived the next day to kill the rest. The convict responsible for cutting the throat of Nazareth could not go all the way with it and made only a small cut on his throat, which sufficed to cause Nazareth to faint, thereby survive the massacre. However, while saving his life, the cut also made him mute. This &quot;cut&quot; not only symbolizes Nazareth's becoming mute but also his being cut from his life and family and the Armenian society's silence about the Genocide at the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompression: No\r\nMovie Quality: DVD9\r\nSize: 8199 Mb\r\nLanguages: Italian, Armenian 5.1 (with italian subtitles)\r\nColors\r\nRuntime: 133 min.\r\nMenu:Yes\r\n\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2245171/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c3451533f7ce3d7405e2b23ec4ed165ec5dec56","amp;dn":"The+Cut+-+Il+Padre+%282014%29+%5BDVD9+-+Ita+Arm+5.1+-+Ita+subs%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c3451533f7ce3d7405e2b23ec4ed165ec5dec56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,52,81,83,63,124,227,215,64,94,43,35,236,78,209,101,236,93,236,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
