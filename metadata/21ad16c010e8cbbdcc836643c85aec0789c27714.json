Palestinians have attacked Israelis in apparently random acts. In some cases the attackers have been young teenagers, armed with kitchen knives. The Gush Etzion junction is one site of many attacks. It's on the main road between Jerusalem and Hebron and is used by thousands of Jewish settlers. The junction used to be a place where Palestinians would also shop and work. Now people are scared that being there could cost them their lives. The film contains disturbing images from the start.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4d/Death-at-the-Junction-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e8/Death-at-the-Junction-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/50/Death-at-the-Junction-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8d/Death-at-the-Junction-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5d/Death-at-the-Junction-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/76/Death-at-the-Junction-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/52/Death-at-the-Junction-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/03/Death-at-the-Junction-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9b/Death-at-the-Junction-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 20 (~2421Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x656\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.95:1\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.50 VBR 48KHz (~123Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 22 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 415 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07986dq","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21ad16c010e8cbbdcc836643c85aec0789c27714","amp;dn":"BBC+Our+World+2016+Death+at+the+Junction+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21ad16c010e8cbbdcc836643c85aec0789c27714","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,173,22,192,16,232,203,189,204,131,102,67,200,90,236,7,137,194,119,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
