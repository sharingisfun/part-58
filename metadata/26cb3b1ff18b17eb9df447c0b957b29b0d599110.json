Here is a samplng of morning\r\nprograms that reinforce that very wise decision.\r\n\r\n1. Good Morning America (ABC)\r\nPt.1 12-10-87\r\nHost: Joan Lunden\r\nCorrespondent: Jeff Greenfield\r\n\r\nInterview covering Sting's humanitarian efforts\r\nwith behind the scenes footage from his concert \r\nin Porto Allegre, Brazil.\r\n\r\n2. Good Morning America (ABC)\r\nPt.2 12-11-87\r\n\r\nJeff Greenfield's interview continued.\r\n\r\n3. The Today Show (NBC)\r\nHost: Bryant Gumbel\r\n\r\nBryant interviews Sting in the NBC Today Show\r\nstudios on the release date of &quot;Ten Summoner's Tales&quot;.\r\n\r\n4. &quot;Live with Regis and Kathie Lee&quot; \r\n3-18-96\r\nHosts: Regis Philbin, Kathie Lee Gifford\r\n\r\nThis one is outrageous...Sting is ambushed by the \r\nmorning talk show cheese factor.  I think he had\r\nno idea what he was getting into, and seems a bit\r\nannoyed when Regis accidentally spits on him.\r\n\r\n5. &quot;The Rosie O'Donnell Show&quot;\r\n3-4-97\r\nHost: Rosie O'Donnell\r\n\r\nSting's wife Trudy Styler joins him on this one\r\nto discuss the premiere of their film -\r\n&quot;Gentlemen Don't Eat Poets&quot;, which was about to \r\nopen in Greenwich Village.  In typical fashion,\r\nRosie has not done a great job with researching her \r\nguests, but thankfully avoids the rock bottom depths of\r\nthe Regis and Kathie Lee appearance a year earlier","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26cb3b1ff18b17eb9df447c0b957b29b0d599110","amp;dn":"Sting+-+Coffee%2C+Tea%2C+or+Sting","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26cb3b1ff18b17eb9df447c0b957b29b0d599110","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,203,59,31,241,139,23,235,157,244,71,192,185,87,178,155,13,89,145,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
