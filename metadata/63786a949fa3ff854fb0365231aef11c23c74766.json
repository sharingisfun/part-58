The booklet is actually the edited version of a lecture, which I have delivered on many occasions and in many locations around the world. The positive response of the varied audiences to this lecture encouraged me to prepare it as a booklet in order to make it accessible to a wider audience.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope that readers will find the thoughts and discussions in this short booklet useful in their personal quest for God, because ul-timately, there is nothing more important in this world than to find God and to live according to His Will. For those who do not care to begin this quest and live by His divine truth, I can only offer a hum-ble prayer that God help them find their way back to Him before their time in this world runs out.\r\n\r\n \nhttp://seekingislam.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63786a949fa3ff854fb0365231aef11c23c74766","amp;dn":"Did+God+Become+Man+epub+2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63786a949fa3ff854fb0365231aef11c23c74766","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,120,106,148,159,163,255,133,79,176,54,82,49,174,241,28,35,199,71,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
