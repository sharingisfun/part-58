Users may still continue to use Java 7 updates on Windows XP at their own risk, but support will only be provided against Microsoft Windows releases Windows Vista or later. \r\n\r\n\r\nA Pentium 2 266 MHz or faster processor with at least 128 MB of physical RAM is recommended.

The app is based on a widely known method of patching the %WinDir%infbth.inf file.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe app works for most, but not all, Bluetooth adapters; whether that be USB dongles or built-in adapters. A strikingly good point about Bluetooth Driver Installer is that before making any changes to your system, the app automatically creates a restore point. This is useful if anything goes wrong. You can use Windows System Restore to revert any changes that have been made to your PC.\r\n\r\n\r\nBluetooth Driver Installer is a reliable app, if the WinDir%infbth.inf file is corrupted in some way then Bluetooth Driver Installer will patch it, thereby repairing any errors you may have. Bluetooth Driver Installer also automatically identifies any devices you have and then can install the compatible driver, if you need it.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, Bluetooth Driver Installer is a great app that is lightweight, has a standard user interface, and is very simple to use; it provides wizards to run you through the process. The app also provides you with data in the form of a detailed report on the device model, manufacturer and subversion used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntel PRO/Wireless and WiFi Link Drivers 14.3.0.6 Vista 64-bit\r\nIntel PRO/Wireless and WiFi Link Drivers 15.8.0 XP 32-bit\r\nIntel PRO/Wireless and WiFi Link Drivers 18.21.0 Win7 64-bit\r\n\r\nIntel PRO/Wireless and WiFi Link Drivers 18.21.0 Win7 32-bit\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection is an embedded 802.11a/b/g PCIe Mini Card network adapter operating in the 2.4GHz and 5GHz spectrum.
