Spain et al. (CRC, 2000).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 1-56670-522-3\r\n\r\nFilled with practical applications and research, Biodegradation of Nitroaromatic Compounds and Explosives presents an international perspective on environmental contamination from explosives. It covers biodegradation strategies for DNT and a wide variety of other nitroaromatic compounds of environmental significance and makes the information accessible to practicing environmental and chemical engineers. Biodegradation of Nitroaromatic Compounds and Explosives gives you a synthesis of ongoing research and an appreciation of the remarkable range of biochemical strategies available for the transformation of nitroaromatic compounds. It provides a realistic assessment of the current and potential field applications of the various strategies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04e9b67bd5fadbb87d7c14d92f782c3586e3afdd","amp;dn":"Biodegradation+of+Nitroaromatic+Compounds+and+Explosives","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04e9b67bd5fadbb87d7c14d92f782c3586e3afdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,233,182,123,213,250,219,184,125,124,20,217,47,120,44,53,134,227,175,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
