Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, Owen Barfield, Charles Williams by Philip Zaleski and Carol Zaleski, PART 2 OF 3.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe husband-and-wife team of Philip and Carol Zaleski bring to bear both extensive scholarship and a neatly interwoven narrative; this is a story about storytellers, and it shows . . . In The Fellowship, the authors never cease to feel for the Inklings, particularly sympathizing with their yearnings for spiritual and professional fulfillment, with occasional wry asides on the nature of their marriages and their politics to take note of shortcomings both personal and institutional. Taken together, it makes the overarching life of the group something greater than the sum of its parts.â€ â€•Genevieve Valentine, The New York Times Book Review\r\n\r\nâ€œThe Zaleskis have produced a major work of biography and criticism, and if you are a devotee of any of the Inklings, you will want to read it.â€ â€•Michael Dirda, The Washington Post\r\n\r\nâ€œThe Zaleskis deftly interweave the four stories [of Lewis, Tolkien, Barfield, and Williams], showing how, when read together, these very different men can help us more clearly see the state of literary and religious culture in mid-century England and beyond.â€ â€•Anthony Domestico, Christian Science Monitor\r\n\r\nâ€œA fascinating overview of this 'intellectual orchestra' . . . a captivating story of young writers finding their literary footing while trying to rectify competing desires for happiness, love, fame, and faith.â€ â€•Ethan Gilsdorf, The Boston Globe\r\n\r\nâ€œThe Fellowship makes a convincing case that [the Inklings's] cultural legacy deserves comparison with that of the less Christian, more intellectually austere Bloomsbury group.â€ â€•Lev Grossman, Time Magazine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7826404d9b8b2f3636b4d96a348d6504743bc5ff","amp;dn":"fellowship-inklings-j-r-r-tolkien-c-s-lewis-part2.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7826404d9b8b2f3636b4d96a348d6504743bc5ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,38,64,77,155,139,47,54,54,180,217,106,52,141,101,4,116,59,197,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
