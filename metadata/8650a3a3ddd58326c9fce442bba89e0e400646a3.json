Knievel made a career out of ridiculous stunts and rose to fame with multiple television appearances of his daredevil stunts that captured the public's imagination throughout the late 1960s and 70s.\r\nWith fantastic archive, the film takes the audience on a rollercoaster ride from his early motorcycle stunts, through to his attempt to be fired across Snake River Canyon, to his time in jail for brutally assaulting his business partner.\r\nThe darker side of Knievel's larger-than-life persona also emerges, especially among those who knew him best. Friends, family and business colleagues paint a complex portrait of a man who preferred to be seen as a self-styled myth. His love of alcohol, womanising, and temper were all eclipsed by an obsession with insane stunts bordering on a death wish.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0e/Being-Evel-Knievel-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3e/Being-Evel-Knievel-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b9/Being-Evel-Knievel-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7f/Being-Evel-Knievel-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b2/Being-Evel-Knievel-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/99/Being-Evel-Knievel-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e4/Being-Evel-Knievel-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b8/Being-Evel-Knievel-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/32/Being-Evel-Knievel-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 21 (~2145Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 24 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.48 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 94 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 1.50 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b076nqjb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8650a3a3ddd58326c9fce442bba89e0e400646a3","amp;dn":"BBC+Storyville+2016+Being+Evel+Knievel+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGrou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8650a3a3ddd58326c9fce442bba89e0e400646a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,80,163,163,221,213,131,38,201,252,228,66,187,168,158,14,64,6,70,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
