Check my account for more classic bootlegs.\r\n \r\nPlease enjoy, share with friends and please seed :)\r\n\r\nSinead Oâ€™Connor\r\nPinkpop Festival\r\nLandgraaf\r\nThe Netherlands\r\n1995-06-05\r\n\r\n01 Famine\r\n02 All babies\r\n03 Thank you for hearing me\r\n04 The last day of our acquaintance\r\n05 I am stretched on your grave\r\n06 In this heart\r\n07 Fire on Babylon\r\n08 Mandinka\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother fine treat I found hidden on one of my VHS tapes! I recorded this from the live broadcast of the festival. Even if you think you have this already - check what you have, as Iâ€™ve never seen or heard the first song in circulation! I believe it was transmitted live, while the rest was broadcast later the same day, or maybe there was an interruption for a news broadcast or something. Anyway, I was really happy to find this, as the image and sound quality are both also pretty fine!\r\n\r\nThe DVD has no menu, and is not indexed. Feel free to re-author it, and share back to the community.\r\n\r\n\r\nSystem: PAL \r\nAspect ratio: 4:3 \r\nVideo: 720 x 576, 9300 Kbps average, 25 fps \r\nAudio: AC3-A52, 256 Kbps \r\n\r\n\r\nLineage: TV &gt; VHS tape (master) &gt; stand-alone DVD recorder (HQ-modus) &gt; DVD &gt; video_ts folder &gt; you \r\n\r\n\r\nA while back, I digitised my old VHS tapes and binned them after recording what I wanted to keep. Most (if not all) of these tapes have been recorded on various hifi stereo video recorders, some in single play, some in long play mode. I've used my most recent video recorder (Sony SLV-SE600) for playback and a stand-alone DVD-recorder (Sony RDR-HX780) to create DVDs. They have no menus and no chapters. If anyone feels compelled to re-author any of them - be my guest","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eda3b9fe30a770dc22cc13ec1f88618871779dc4","amp;dn":"Sinead+O%27Connor%2C+1995-06-05%2C+Pinkpop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eda3b9fe30a770dc22cc13ec1f88618871779dc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,163,185,254,48,167,112,220,34,204,19,236,31,136,97,136,113,119,157,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
