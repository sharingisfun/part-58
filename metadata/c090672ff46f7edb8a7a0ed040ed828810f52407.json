Virgil's Aeneid is as eternal as Rome itself, a sweeping epic of arms and heroism--the searching portrait of a man caught between love and duty, human feeling and the force of fate--that has influenced writers for over 2,000 years.  Filled with drama, passion, and the universal pathos that only a masterpiece can express. The Aeneid is a book for all the time and all people","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c090672ff46f7edb8a7a0ed040ed828810f52407","amp;dn":"The+Aeneid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c090672ff46f7edb8a7a0ed040ed828810f52407","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,144,103,47,244,111,126,219,138,122,14,208,64,237,130,136,16,245,36,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
