As a result, he managed to enter permanently into the mainstream and be finally (and rightly so), appreciated for his vocal and songwriting talent. Although - as sang in the Homo Twist - &quot;SzoÅ‚biznes prayer pats in the key of D / What do I care scuffle in such kitsch / Ni sister to me than a brother, he never&quot; decided to enter between crows and croak like them. Now, apparently bored of playing the &quot;banquet&quot;, he decided to tame, mainstream socket crows explode from the inside grabbing the most ambitious thing in his career - playing jazz.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01.
