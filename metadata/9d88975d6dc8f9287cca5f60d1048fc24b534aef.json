Bob Zimmerman, Behindtheblack.com.\r\n\r\nâ€œNew Shepard flies again, for the third time. The competition heats up: On Saturday Blue Origin successfully launched and landed its reusable New Shepard suborbital capsule/rocket spacecraft.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe vehicle lifted off from the companyâ€™s test site shortly after 11 a.m. Eastern time, according to a series of tweets by company founder Jeff Bezos. The vehicleâ€™s propulsion module, the same one that flew earlier test flights in November and January, made a successful powered landing, he said. Its crew capsule, flying without people on board, parachuted to a safe landing. â€¦ The vehicle reached a peak altitude of nearly 103.4 kilometers, slightly above the â€œvon Karman lineâ€ frequently used as the boundary of space and similar to previous test flights.\r\n\r\nâ€œThis flight also carried some science experiments, demonstrating that Blue Originâ€™s customers will not be limited merely to space tourists.â€\r\n \nhttp://behindtheblack.com/behind-the-black/points-of-information/new-shepard-flies-again-for-the-third-time/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d88975d6dc8f9287cca5f60d1048fc24b534aef","amp;dn":"blue-origin-is-a-hollywood-boxoffice-hit-bob-zimmerman.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d88975d6dc8f9287cca5f60d1048fc24b534aef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,136,151,93,109,200,249,40,124,202,95,96,209,4,143,194,75,83,74,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
