While mainstream media is focusing almost entirely on the Rules Committee, Ingraham pressed the Chairman on the other committees: Credentials and Platform.\r\n\r\nLast week, Republican frontrunner Donald Trump discussed the possibility of reaching out to the Cruz campaign to insist the Trans-Pacific Partnership and border security are preeminent in the GOP platform. Despite the ongoing Trump-Cruz feud, Trump conceded reaching out is, â€œnot a bad idea.â€ However, the billionaire noted Cruzâ€™s previous support for the TPP, stressing the importance of monetary manipulation clauses, which the Texas senator opposes. In contrast, Trump, who has been fighting the TPP from the beginning, promised to insist that in the Party platform the TPP will not be approved moving forward.\r\n\r\n\r\nTed Cruz wins almost all of Maine's delegates at convention\r\nOnce again, Ted Cruz's campaign has used the Republican Party delegate selection process to outperform his results on Election Day in hopes of wrangling a nomination during the national convention in Cleveland this summer.\r\n\r\nGoldman Sachs Employee Fired After Buying Donald Trump Hats Plans To Sue The Big Bank\r\n\r\nAbout 200,000 convicted felons in Virginia will now have the right to vote in November\r\n\r\nPolitico Reporter: Trump Put RNC Into 'Submission'\r\n\r\nGet Ready for Huge Obamacare Premium Hikes in 2017\r\nAmid rising drug and health care costs and roiling market dynamics, the spokesperson for the nation's health insurers is predicting substantial increases next year in Obamacare premiums and related costs\r\n\r\nESPN's Progressive Hypocrisy\r\nCurt Schilling tells blunt and uncomfortable truths, so there is no place for him in progressive corporate America. Last summer, ESPN suspended him for a personalpost that rightly compared Muslim extremists to Nazis and rightly noted that even a minority of extremists can cause catastrophic conflict. But in the world of progressive corporate politics, the truth is &quot;Islamophobic&quot; and must be punished. Yesterday, ESPN fired Schilling. His offense? Posting a crude meme on his personalpage that took direct aim at allowing men access to women's restrooms. He also wrote, &quot;A man is a man no matter what they call themselves. I don't care what they are, who they sleep with, men's room was designed for the penis, women's not so much. Now you need laws telling us differently? Pathetic.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff4ddf13afb809730bedd4a16b5fcc4f86c4573f","amp;dn":"The+Laura+Ingraham+Show+Podcast+April+25%2C+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff4ddf13afb809730bedd4a16b5fcc4f86c4573f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,77,223,19,175,184,9,115,11,237,212,161,107,95,204,79,134,196,87,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
