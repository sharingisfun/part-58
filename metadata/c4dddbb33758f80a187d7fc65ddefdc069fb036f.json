Focusing on the golden age of railroading between World War II and the early 1970s, this all-new book features the histories, locomotives, rolling stock, and memorabilia of railroads like the Delaware &amp; Hudson; Erie Lackawanna; Gulf, Mobile &amp; Ohio; St. Louis-San Francisco Railway; Maine Central; Nickle Plate Road; Southern Railway; Great Northern Railway; and others. Amazingly preserved color photography from the decades covered, along with archival black-and-white images, capture the legendary trains against scenic backdrops across the nation, while period print ads and brochures add a nostalgic element to the stories behind the railroads' passenger and freight operations. Mike Schafer has written several rail-related books for MBI, including Streamliner Memories, Freight Train Cars, and Classic American Railroads","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4dddbb33758f80a187d7fc65ddefdc069fb036f","amp;dn":"More+Classic+American+Railroads+%28Train+History%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4dddbb33758f80a187d7fc65ddefdc069fb036f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,221,219,179,55,88,248,10,24,125,127,198,93,222,253,192,105,251,3,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
