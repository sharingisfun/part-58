These are all live recordings made between March 8, 1962 and November 17, 1964 at the BBC when The Beatles were just beginning to get popular. They cover the period from the beginning to Help!. If you want to see whatâ€™s on here before downloading you can go to bootleg zone and search for â€œBeatles Complete BBCâ€ and it will be the set known as  â€œupgraded for 2004.â€ All folders contain correctly tagged tracks and CD cover artwork.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd5f016753715ba07316a024b4c1eb0d55fad360","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+%26ndash%3B+The+Complete+BBC+Sessions+10CD+MP3+320kH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd5f016753715ba07316a024b4c1eb0d55fad360","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,95,1,103,83,113,91,160,115,22,160,36,180,193,235,13,85,250,211,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
