Here, you will not find the same old tips and tricks on how to save money by re-using teabags or buying rice in bulk. Instead, weâ€™ll get to the very heart of what money actually means, how we spend it and why, and what you can do to start using what you have right now to create a lifestyle that has meaning for you. \r\n\r\nWeâ€™ll consider the root causes of careless spending, as well as the three biggest but largely invisible money myths we all believe in to some extent. Weâ€™ll then consider ways to start creating a budget that works for you and your goals, rather than against it","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a781f4ab4271a14a5da8f820c7b1f269fe3cd4d7","amp;dn":"Dollars+No+Sense+Why+Are+You+Spending+Your+Money+Like+An+Idiot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a781f4ab4271a14a5da8f820c7b1f269fe3cd4d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,129,244,171,66,113,161,74,93,168,248,32,199,177,242,105,254,60,212,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
