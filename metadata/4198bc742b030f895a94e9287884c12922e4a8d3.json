Gen. Chris Bogdan told reporters that the plane could fly without the $16.7 billion Autonomic Logistics Information System, or ALIS, for at least 30 days. The software, which runs on ground computers, not the plane itself, manages the aircraftâ€™s supply chain, aircraft configuration, fault diagnostics, mission planning and debriefing â€” none of which are critical to combat flight.\r\n\r\nâ€œAsked whether the problems cited in the GAO report were severe enough to ground the fleet, a Defense Department official involved in the program and speaking on condition of anonymity, matter-of-factly said â€œno.â€...\r\n \nhttp://www.defenseone.com/technology/2016/04/f-35-will-fly-despite-auditors-fleet-grounding-warning/127561/?oref=d-river\r\n \nhttp://www.govexec.com/defense/2016/04/15-years-government-wants-its-satellites-adapt-threats-fly/127425/?oref=d-river\r\n \nhttp://www.govexec.com/defense/2016/04/problem-pentagons-hypersonic-missile/127547/?oref=d-river\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4198bc742b030f895a94e9287884c12922e4a8d3","amp;dn":"John-Batchelor-glitchy-f-35-satellite-repair.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4198bc742b030f895a94e9287884c12922e4a8d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,152,188,116,43,3,15,137,90,148,233,40,120,132,193,41,34,228,168,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
