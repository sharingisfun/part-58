Check my account for more classic bootlegs.\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy, share with friends and please seed :)\r\n\r\n&quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;\r\nDecember 12, 1967 (original airdate) - U.S. TV - abc Network\r\n\r\nVenue: El Capitan Theater (owned by ABC at the time and renamed the &quot;ABC Hollywood Palace&quot;)\r\nHollywood, California, U.S.A.\r\n\r\nThe A&amp;M Records 1967 TV Special featuring:\r\n\r\n--host: Herb Alpert\r\n--Herb Alpert &amp; the Tijuana Brass--Wes Montgomery\r\n--Burt Bacharach\r\n--Liza Minnelli\r\n--Sergio Mendes &amp; Brasil '66\r\n--The Baja Marimba Band\r\n--Boyce &amp; Hart\r\n\r\nIn COLOR with nearly perfect picture &amp; very decent TV sound quality. Grade A!\r\n\r\nAlso features all of the original 1967 TV commercials!\r\nThis was previously posted as a flawed unplayable DVD. Various rework methods were posted in the earlier seed comments but most of the programs used to do this probably involved re-encoding of the data. This version here did not involve any re-encoding of the media and better title and chapter menus were added. Since the original audio was LPCM, it could be extensively fine-tuned with Pro Tools - normalization of the very low levels by almost 15 dB, other level change repairs with silencing of blank spots, lots of clicks manually removed, plus some low end EQ boost to make the TV sound a bit less tinny-sounding. No digital noise reduction was used in the audio remastering process.\r\n\r\nHere's the rest of the new lineage/remastering info:The audio and video media was extracted losslessly by Cinematize 2 as elementary stream files. The video media is the same 2 files, though they were cropped tighter with DVD Studio Pro when authoring to clip the blank beginning and some of the l-o-o-o-n-n-g abc station ID that was at the end (cut to about 5 seconds from the original 30 seconds).\r\n\r\nShow transcript details:--Opening credits \r\n--Commercials: (1) Pruf spray starch; (2) Ultra-Brite toothpaste ad with couple flirting on airplane.
