In this series of lessons we will learn how to rig vehicles in Maya and learn proper vehicle animation techniques. Throughout this series we will learn how to create a seamless vehicle rig that will provide the animator with the control needed to create realistic animation. We will start with preparing our model for rigging with a proper naming convention and hierarchy. Step by step we will learn how to set up controls for steering and rotating the wheels as well as building a full custom suspension. We will learn how to clean up our rig to make it simpler to use and be seamlessly passed off to an animator. We will also go through the process of creating realistic animation including setting up a shot camera, blocking the animation, adjusting the animation curves and viewing a motion trail. We will also cover animating the suspension for our car to give the it a sense of weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's the course introduction: http://www.digitaltutors.com/tutorial/69-Vehicle-Animation-Dynamics-in-Maya","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cff09fae9c12bec4e9bd90dd3c2968eca17d5e4b","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+Vehicle+Animation+Dynamics+in+Maya%28reupload%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cff09fae9c12bec4e9bd90dd3c2968eca17d5e4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,240,159,174,156,18,190,196,233,189,144,221,60,41,104,236,161,125,94,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
