A timeless classic for all ages!\r\nDespite the film's low budget, director Dan Smith was able to craft an engrossing story about strange alien beings and titan-size monsters (sometimes filming without a script!). It is a thrill ride overflowing with elaborate weaponry, eye-catching special effects, lots of technological noises, and of course: plenty of explosions! For the first time in decades, this tour de force is coming to DVD, so a new generation can experience this sci-fi cult classic.\r\nLaugh-a-minute director commentary! â€“ Director Dan Smith lends his decades of industry know-how to deliver side-splitting anecdotes and insights on the film's production. You won't want to miss a single syllable from the genius mind behind this masterpiece!\r\nGot vertigo? Too bad! â€“ Experience the awesome verticality of the tower at every step of the journey, with wide-angle camera shots and impressive aerial stunts. Watch as our heroes fearlessly dive off the tower or glide effortlessly across chasms, all in search of hidden secrets and intergalactic glory!\r\nOver half-a-hundred imaginative monsters! â€“ Squid people, nukular ants, dinosaurs-gone-wild, giant blobs, robo-monkeys, and more are brought to life using state-of-the-art effects, including stop-motion, rotoscope, image compositing, and even some elaborate costumes covered in real fur! You and the family are guaranteed a good ol' time!\r\nRay guns, crystal swords, and laser whips. Oh, my! â€“ At the heroes' disposal are a wide variety of weapons used to smack!, pow!, and ker-splat! their futuristic foes. Watch as our plucky protagonists collect hidden scrap metal pieces and upgrade their arsenal, right before your very eyes!\r\nDid someone say, &quot;Special powers&quot;!? â€“ I sure hope so, because this film's got 'em! From time-slowing vortexes to speed boots... Wait, what's that on the ground? Is that a bird? No, it's a land mine! These aliens are in for a bang, and so are you!\r\n\r\nMinimum system requirements - Windows: XP/ Vista/ 7/ 8/ 10 \r\nProcessor: Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4 GHz or AMD Athlon X2 4800+ \r\nMemory: 2 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce 9800M GTS 1024MB or ATI Radeon HD 5750/6670 1024MB \r\nDirectX: Version 9.0c \r\nStorage: 4 GB available space\r\nMouse, Keyboard\r\nRecommended system requirements - Windows: XP/ Vista/ 7/ 8/ 10\r\nProcessor: Intel Core i5 \r\nMemory: 4 GB RAM \r\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 280 \r\nDirectX: Version 9.0c \r\nStorage: 4 GB available space\r\nMouse, Keyboard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12227579e5342a107ea323f5c5476da977aa9b02","amp;dn":"The+Deadly+Tower+of+Monsters+%28GOG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12227579e5342a107ea323f5c5476da977aa9b02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,34,117,121,229,52,42,16,126,163,35,245,197,71,109,169,119,170,155,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
