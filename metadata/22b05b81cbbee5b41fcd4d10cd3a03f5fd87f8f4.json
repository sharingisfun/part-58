Debra Saunders, San Francisco Chronicle. Mary Kissel, Wall Street Journal Editorial Board &amp; host of Opinion Journal on WSJ Video.\r\n\r\nâ€œTheyâ€™re both iconic figures in American culture who are known by their first names. Californiaâ€™s former governor is Arnold. The GOP presidential front-runner is The Donald. We Californians, who lived through Arnoldâ€™s two terms in the governorâ€™s office, have watched The Donaldâ€™s presidential campaign unfold with a sense of deja vu.\r\n\r\nDonald Trump starred in the TV show â€œCelebrity Apprentice.â€ Arnold Schwarzenegger will replace him. Both men can boast supersize personalities and bulging bank accounts. Both ran for a top office with no political experience whatsoever â€” which turned out to be a plus as they tapped into a tidal wave of voter resentment. Both are more pragmatic than Schwarzeneggerâ€™s supporters thought he could not win a GOP primary â€” and he didnâ€™t have to, because he ran and won in Californiaâ€™s free-for-all recall election of 2003. Trumpâ€™s front-runner status in the 2016 primary â€” also the beneficiary of a crowded field â€” likewise has confounded the political professional class.\r\n \nhttp://www.sfgate.com/opinion/saunders/article/Would-The-Donald-govern-like-Arnold-7093719.php\r\n \nhttp://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-20160330-htmlstory.html#5406","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22b05b81cbbee5b41fcd4d10cd3a03f5fd87f8f4","amp;dn":"JohnBatchelor-schwarzenegger-compared-to-trump.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22b05b81cbbee5b41fcd4d10cd3a03f5fd87f8f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,176,91,129,203,190,229,180,31,205,77,16,205,58,3,245,253,135,248,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
