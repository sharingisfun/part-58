Hotel Mars with David Livingston &amp; Jeff Foust.\r\n\r\napril 22, 2016 mp3\r\n\r\nDonald Trump Has Reason to Cry Foul Over a â€˜Rigged Electionâ€™April 20, 2016\r\n\r\nOnto the next! The New York primary is in the rear-view mirror, but the scramble for Republican delegates is far from over. Next Tuesday, April 26, GOP primaries will take place in Pennsylvania,...\r\n\r\nIf front-runner Trump does not arrive in Cleveland with 1,237 delegates in hand â€“ the requisite majority needed to become the nominee â€“ the convention will vote, and then vote again until one candidate reaches that magic number. After the first round, in which 5 percent of the delegates are â€œunbound,â€ 59 percent of the delegates are free to change their affiliation; after the second ballot, 80 percent can do so.\r\n\r\nVoters should ask: how do you court a delegate? What can Ted Cruz, or any of the candidates, offer these men and women to secure their second-ballot votes?\r\n\r\nFor starters, he can pitch his policies, or the effort he will make on behalf of a delegateâ€™s home-state candidates. He can argue that he has the best shot at beating Hillary Clinton, or that his polling in the candidateâ€™s state looks great for the â€œdown-ballotâ€ crowd.\r\n\r\nHe might also offer to include a delegate in some policy-making committee, allow them to act as a campaign surrogate, or suggest that a person could fill a slot in the â€œtransition team.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/04/20/Donald-Trump-Has-Reason-Cry-Foul-Over-Rigged-Election\r\n\r\n___________\r\n\r\nHOLLYWOOD, Fla. â€” Out on the campaign trail, Donald Trump relishes his feud with his own party. He threatened to sue the Republican National Committee. He called its nominating system â€œrigged,â€ â€œdeceptiveâ€ and â€œa disgrace.â€ And he has suggested he might try to depose the party chairman.\r\n\r\nBut as RNC members gathered at a palatial beach resort here this week, Trumpâ€™s aides launched an urgent effort aimed at rebranding the mogulâ€™s persona and thawing hostilities with the skittish party elite.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe need unity as soon as possible,â€ said Ed Cox, the New York party chairman and a Trump supporter.\r\n\r\nYet while the charm offensive has made some progress, interviews with dozens of GOP officials here showed that the celebrity billionaire still has to overcome a host of lingering concerns â€” both about his loyalty to the party as well as his discipline and electability as a candidate.\r\n\r\nâ€œWeâ€™re the ones that built this party,â€ said Jonathan Barnett, a national committeeman from Arkansas. â€œYou see so many states where they have never reached out or built an organization. .â€‰.â€‰. Remember, weâ€™re good people. Weâ€™re the grass roots. Weâ€™ve been around a long time. And Trump needs us.â€\r\n \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/some-gop-elites-arent-quite-convinced-by-trump-charm-offensive/2016/04/22/3e0e5160-089e-11e6-bdcb-0133da18418d_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_rnctrump-7pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6be202f6209e6a203ac1452193a8f1849255e169","amp;dn":"John-Batchelor-new-trump-delayed-zero-emissions-rollout.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6be202f6209e6a203ac1452193a8f1849255e169","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,226,2,246,32,158,106,32,58,193,69,33,147,168,241,132,146,85,225,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
