McDougall, University of Pennsylvania, Pulitzer Prizeâ€“winning author of ...the Heavens and the Earth: A Political History of the Space Age\r\n\r\nâ€œNick Sambaluk's fascinating book deals with the past but speaks to the presentâ€•an advanced technology Air Force project, rising costs, uncertain mission: and no, it's not the F-35! As Sambaluk shows in his analysis of the â€˜Dyna-Soarâ€™ project, sometimes the past really can be prologue.â€â€• Robert M. Citino, author of The Wehrmacht Retreats: The Campaigns of 1943\r\n\r\nâ€œDr. Sambaluk fills a void in the historiography of America's space technology. He addresses many of the factors and competing interests that shaped America's early space programs. A well-researched and organized work that should be on the shelf of every historian of the â€˜new frontier.â€™â€â€•Dr. John Curatola, U.S. Army Command and General Staff College\r\n\r\nâ€œSambaluk lays bare the tension between the military strategies and policies of presidents and the competing goals of the military industrial complex. The Other Space Race should be on the reading lists of every member of Congress, the current and next presidential administration, and any American citizen concerned with the nationâ€™s military affairs.â€ â€• Col. Gian Gentile, USA (Ret.), author of Wrong Turn: America's Deadly Embrace of Counterinsurgency; former professor of military history at West Point; senior historian at the RAND Corporation\r\n\r\nâ€œNick Sambaluk has written an important new book about Ike and the early days of the space race. He provides insights into Eisenhower in a field that has deserved more historical exploration.â€ â€• William B.
