The player collects various items and weapons used to fight and kill zombies that are located or looted from different areas. If the player's character is killed by a zombie (which can occur with a single bite), the character will permanently die and the player will then take the role of another random survivor. The previous character will become a zombie, whom the player must kill in order to reclaim his original inventory. If the player has Miiverse enabled, it is possible that other players' characters will also appear as zombies carrying the items they had collected. The player can also tag clues and hints onto walls that other players can see when they're on their own adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou just need to mount the iso with Daemon Tool lite , install with the setup.exe inside and copy the crack folder on the root folder of the game .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHave a nice game :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85d4b4af1a677ab29fd6dd3c0d687fb263a3a22b","amp;dn":"Zombi-Corepack.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85d4b4af1a677ab29fd6dd3c0d687fb263a3a22b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,212,180,175,26,103,122,178,159,214,221,60,13,104,127,178,99,163,162,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
