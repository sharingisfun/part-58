The story, based on Aldous Huxley's The Devils of Loudun, concerns controversial 17th century French priest Urbain Grandier, whose radical political and religious notions and profligate sex life earn him many enemies. When a group of nuns appears to have been &quot;bewitched&quot; by Grandier, his rivals feed on the resulting mass hysteria, using this incident as an excuse to have the priest arrested. Refusing to confess to being in league with Satan and to renounce his &quot;heretical&quot; views, Grandier undergoes appalling tortures, and is finally burned at the stake. Vanessa Redgrave co-stars as the head nun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTARS.........: Vanessa Redgrave, Oliver Reed, Dudley Sutton \r\nDIRECTOR......: Ken Russell\r\nWRITERS.......: Ken Russell\r\nGENRE.........: Drama | History\r\nRATING........: 7.8/10 8,175 votes\r\nIMDB link.....: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066993\r\nRUNTIME.......: 1h 51mn\r\nSIZE..........: 4.27GB\r\nVIDEO CODEC...: x264 (  )\r\nRESOLUTION....: 1920x820\r\nASPECT RATIO..: 2.35:1\r\nBITRATE.......: 5146 Kbps\r\nFRAMERATE.....: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO1........: English 2.0 Mono AC3 256kbps\r\nAUDIO2........: Commentary with Ken Russell, Mark Kermode, Michael Bradsell and Paul Joyce\r\nCHAPTERS......: Yes\r\nSUBTITLES.....: English, French, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish\r\nSOURCE........: BFI DVD9\r\nENCODED BY....: Sartre\r\nENCODE DATE...: 2016-04-11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an upscale of the BFI dvd.
