The band consists of Mary Halvorson on guitar, Michael Formanek\r\non bass, Brian Settles on tenor saxophone and flute and Jonathan Finlayson on\r\ntrumpet. â€œLastlyâ€ opens with drums, a little skittering guitar and a touch of\r\nflute giving the proceedings a mysterious air. They develop a medium tempo,\r\nwith trumpet sliding in over flinty shards of guitar. Cymbals shimmer and call\r\nthe group patiently to order, before moving to a percussion based trumpet\r\nsolo. Nimble guitar and drums set the tone for â€The Combâ€ which has shards of\r\nguitar and percussion, both of which are light and graceful. There is a\r\nselection of collective improvisation, which like almost all of the music on\r\nthis album has a shape-shifting quality where everything is not quite what it\r\nseems. After a graceful drum feature on â€œFor Tom and Geraldâ€ the group returns\r\non â€œBoasterâ€™s Roastâ€ where trumpet and angular guitar develop a sense of\r\nopenness amidst rumbling drums. The music builds quickly with hammering\r\npercussion and squalls of epic guitar, followed by the full band returning in\r\nlayers. The music changes so rapidly that it is hard to keep track, it is\r\nimpressive in its complexity and quite immersive as each member of the band is\r\nattuned to the others. Fujiwara leads by example with tight and amazingly\r\nsupple control of his instrument. â€œSolar Windâ€ has hollow sounding drums that\r\ndevelop a complex rhythm. Settlesâ€™ saxophone nudges in setting up a fine trio\r\nsection, added to with Finlaysonâ€™s trumpet making for a conversational\r\nsound. There are solo sections for trumpet and bass, shaded ably by Mary\r\nHalvorsonâ€™s guitar. This is a very interesting group that makes the most of\r\ntheir long time together by developing a unique band identity.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBy Chris Haines \nhttp://www.freejazzblog.org/2015/07/tomas-fujiwara-hook-up-after-all-is.html\r\n\r\nBy Glenn Astarita \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/after-all-is-said-tomas-fujiwara-482-music-review-by-glenn-astarita.php\r\n\r\nBy Troy Collins \nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/after-all-is-said-tomas-fujiwara-482-music-review-by-troy-collins.php\r\n\r\nBy Raul da Gama \nhttp://www.jazzdagama.com/reviews/cds/tomas-fujiwara-the-hook-up-after-all-is-said/\r\n\r\nPar Franpi Barriaux (fr) \nhttp://www.citizenjazz.com/Tomas-Fujiwara-The-Hook-Up.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8da3ddcb856a4aff588d38d3fa7ba92a3614adb9","amp;dn":"Tomas+Fujiwara+and+The+Hook+Up+-+After+All+Is+Said+%282015%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8da3ddcb856a4aff588d38d3fa7ba92a3614adb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,163,221,203,133,106,74,255,88,141,56,211,250,123,169,42,54,20,173,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
