This may sound like a manifesto aimed at saving things of value, because yes, in a world of unlimited communication and millennium hysteria, Kroke do want us to think about things that are really important in life: &quot;Earth&quot; &quot;Water&quot; &quot;Fire&quot; or &quot;Love&quot;, for example, to mention titles on this CD.\r\n\r\nHowever &quot;Sounds of the Vanishing world&quot; is also about the important events of the last decades. Basing their work on the Eastern European and Balkans tradition of Klezmer music, they also include jazz, improvisation, pop, avant-garde music and much more. The music of these three excellent musicians, well known in Klezmer circles, is always exciting and full of surprises. You even get to feel the enjoyment they have in breaking new ground with their music!\r\n\r\nLast but not least it should be mentioned that this Kroke CD, like their three previous ones, was produced in Krakow. This city itself is a symbol of a disappearing world. Yet the city's long history provides its lively cultural life with inspiration. Kroke is proof enough of the vitality, variety, and ability to innovate that characterises polish culture at this time.\r\n\r\nKROKE and ORIENTE Musik received the German Phonogram Critics Award 2000 for this record.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
