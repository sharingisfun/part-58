Players create a Sim character and control their life to explore different personalities which change the way the game plays out. Sims can multitask such as talk while doing a task. Sims' moodlets also change the gameplay. For example, a Sim can do a task while being either angry or totally excited.\r\n\r\nExpansion packs\r\nGet To Work \r\nGet Together \r\n\r\nGame packs\r\nOutdoor Retreat\r\nSpa Day\r\n\r\nStuff Packs \r\nLuxury Party Stuff[82]\t\r\nWW May 19, 2015\r\nThe first stuff pack, released on May 19, 2015.
