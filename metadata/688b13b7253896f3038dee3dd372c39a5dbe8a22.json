As a warm up the Coast to Coast Blues Band playing some Blues Standards: I Wouldn't Treat A Dog (Bobby 'Blue' Bland), Leave My Woman Alone (Ray Charles), Jailhouse Blues (Lightnin' Hopkins), Cold, Cold Feeling (Albert Collins), A Man Size Job (Denise LaSalle). The sound quality is excellent to perfect. But there was a little confusion about the main info's. I grabbed it from another forum with wrong or lacking song titles - so I corrected them and added tagging. The original info also  postulated Duke Robillard on guitar (tracks 3 &amp; 4) and Debbie Davies on guitar (tracks 6-8). I'm not sure about it. But it's definitely Vala Cupp on vocals (tracks 6-8), who was not credited in the original info sheet. - maxblues","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:688b13b7253896f3038dee3dd372c39a5dbe8a22","amp;dn":"John+Lee+Hooker+-+Columbia%2C+MD+1992+%28SBD%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"688b13b7253896f3038dee3dd372c39a5dbe8a22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,139,19,183,37,56,150,243,3,141,238,61,211,114,195,154,93,190,138,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
