When the Virgin Mary appears to her in a cavern near Lourdes, no one takes the girl seriously, even when she digs up a wellspring at the Virgin's instructions The local authorities even try to hush up the entire incident. In vain, however, because when Empress EugÃ©nie requests water from the spring for her sickly son, they are forced to acquiesce. And even the local priest is finally convinced. While taking his tuberculosis-stricken fiancÃ© Claire to a sanatorium, the young doctor Henri Guillaumet meets Bernadette. The water from Lourdes' spring heals Claire's disease overnight, but the scientist in Henri doubts the miracle and wants to expose Bernadette as a liar. It is not until Henri again meets Bernadette, who has in the meantime become a nun and works as a nurse, that he finds a way to balance belief and modern science. And his love for Claire is strengthened as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Info\r\n\r\nCompression: No\r\nMovie Quality: DVD9\r\nSize: 7724 Mb\r\nLanguages:Italian Ac3 2.0\r\nSubtitles: Italian\r\nColors\r\nRuntime: 94 min. + 94 min. \r\nMenu:Yes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e6d530a2429ca0d067baa9cc7df902a0a6766f9","amp;dn":"Lourdes+%282000%29+%5BDVD9+-+Ita+-+NUIta+subs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e6d530a2429ca0d067baa9cc7df902a0a6766f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,109,83,10,36,41,202,13,6,123,170,156,199,223,144,42,10,103,102,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
