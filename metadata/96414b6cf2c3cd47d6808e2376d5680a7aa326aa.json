So if you want any of my torrents, you need to download them while the getting is good, because no one seeds my torrents, and I will stop seeding after initial seeding is complete. It would be nice if at least some of you did seed though.\r\n\r\ncOOt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96414b6cf2c3cd47d6808e2376d5680a7aa326aa","amp;dn":"Bronco+-+Season+4+%5BDVDRip%5D%5BXviD%5D+-+cOOt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96414b6cf2c3cd47d6808e2376d5680a7aa326aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,65,75,108,242,195,205,71,214,128,142,35,118,213,104,10,122,163,38,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
