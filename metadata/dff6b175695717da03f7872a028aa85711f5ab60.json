Burwell, which addresses the extent to which religious institutions, such as the Little Sisters of the Poor, are subject to the Affordable Care Actâ€™s contraceptive mandate. This case shows just how difficult it has become to protect religious liberty from overweening state power. As context, the case is governed by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, under which the government has to demonstrate that its violation of religious freedom was done in furtherance of a â€œcompelling state interest.â€ But the state has no compelling interest in supplying contraceptive care to women, and, even if it did, it has absolutely no compelling interest in forcing the insurer of religious organizations to pay for that subsidized coverage. The expense should fall on the public purse if such payments are held to be in the public interestâ€¦\r\n \nhttp://www.hoover.org/research/plea-little-sisters","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dff6b175695717da03f7872a028aa85711f5ab60","amp;dn":"JohnBatchelor-little-sisters-of-the-poor-vs-supremecourt.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dff6b175695717da03f7872a028aa85711f5ab60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,246,177,117,105,87,23,218,3,247,135,42,2,138,168,87,17,245,171,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
