The Egyptians have been mediating reconciliation talks between Fatah and Hamas with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbasâ€™ Fatah Party eyeing a security presence along the Gaza-Egypt border. Abbas is due in Egypt next week for consultations.\r\n\r\nâ€œOver the last 24 hours, Hamas militants fired at least six times at IDF forces searching for terror tunnels along the Israel-Gaza border. The Israel Air Force retaliated by firing at Hamas targets in Gaza on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nHamasâ€™s escalation seems to be further aimed at signalling that it is willing to take risks to prevent the IDF from destroying the terror tunnels, which are critical to Hamasâ€™s battle-plans and regional power.\r\n\r\nâ€œHamas is also increasingly desperate as its economy is on the brink of collapse, and it may be using the violence to send a message to Israel and the international community that the Islamist group is willing to draw Israel into conflict if Hamasâ€™s financial needs are not met. Renewed hostilities would also help to redirect Palestinian anger away from Hamasâ€™s own failing government and toward the Jewish state.\r\n \nhttp://www.breitbart.com/jerusalem/2016/05/04/hamas-testing-israels-preparedness-war-provocative-cross-border-attacks/\r\n \nhttp://www.breitbart.com/author/aaron-klein/\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\t\r\n \nhttp://www.breitbart.com/author/aaron-klein/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f07d1a3c9662ddc82ef975be540a16adf3ddd33a","amp;dn":"Trump+Supports+Israel.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f07d1a3c9662ddc82ef975be540a16adf3ddd33a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,125,26,60,150,98,221,200,46,249,117,190,84,10,22,173,243,221,211,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
