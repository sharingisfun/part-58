But since I\r\nhaven't yet seen other uploads of Beach House's fine 2016 Coachella set, \r\nI thought I'd share my not-quite-immaculate, though quite\r\nwatchable/listenable one. And it's the complete set. Fans deserve access to it.\r\nUnfortunately, the Coachella organization is grimly draconian in banning &amp; suppressing youtube, Dailymotion, and other such site uploads of Coachella gigs. \r\n\r\nMy recording is 720p HD, not 1080p full HD. Also is has three tiny, barely noticeable audio drop outs of between just 1/20th &amp; 1/10th of a second in length. \r\nThe video transitions where the file-joining occurred are much smoother &amp; even harder to notice than the audio ones. And all three occur at non-crucial times (two between songs &amp; one near the very end of a song). They occur at spots where I joined separate video file segments together to form this one continuous video file. I had some techical issues preventing me recording the whole gig together in one file, originally. The video editor program I used doesn't join video fies seamlessly.\r\n...............................................\r\nIt ony happens about once every couple of years I encounter a band whose music wows me.I've become hard to please, musically, it seems. But Beach House is one of those rare bands whose music is, for moving, very moving. Victoria &amp; Alex have prodigious talent few bands have, imo. And this Coachella gig \r\nis some more proof of it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebb9bf37b8e94f52bb955cbf93cf2b0b743a03f0","amp;dn":"Beach+House+-+Coachella+04-17-2016%2CVIDEO+livestream","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebb9bf37b8e94f52bb955cbf93cf2b0b743a03f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,185,191,55,184,233,79,82,187,149,92,191,147,207,43,11,116,58,3,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
