It is an educational format made up of five simple steps for creating photorealistic renders in the field of pre-visualization for architecture, mechanics and design. It uses photography - and the basic concepts behind it - as point of reference. Framing, Light Balance, Materials, Final Settings and Post-production are the five crucial phases in the innovative 5-Step Render Workflow (5SRW) method. Examined without technicalities, these phases form a simple and deliberate pathway that aims to guide and encourage full awareness of each step leading to the creation of any kind of render. Each topic has a theoretical introduction, designed to prepare the reader for the pratical use of the V-Ray parameters","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9611a4aca24499bff3cc08da0c74c5ea2e5e70a","amp;dn":"Photography+%26amp%3B+Rendering+with+V-Ray+BY+Ciro+Sannino+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9611a4aca24499bff3cc08da0c74c5ea2e5e70a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,97,26,74,202,36,73,155,255,60,192,141,160,199,76,94,162,229,231,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
