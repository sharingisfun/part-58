Stu and Jeff worked out of an office located at 77 Sunset Strip in Los Angeles, right next door to a snazzy restaurant where Kookie worked as a valet. The finger-snapping, slang-talking Kookie occasionally helped Stu and Jeff with their cases, and eventually became a full-fledged member of the detective agency. Rex Randolph and J.R. Hale also joined the firm, and Suzanne was their leggy secretary.\r\n- Written by Marty McKee &lt;  &gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bfa366f1792d425f9fcc1abc1290ef0fdbb2a628","amp;dn":"77+Sunset+Strip+%28almost+complete%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bfa366f1792d425f9fcc1abc1290ef0fdbb2a628","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,163,102,241,121,45,66,95,159,204,26,188,18,144,239,15,219,178,166,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
