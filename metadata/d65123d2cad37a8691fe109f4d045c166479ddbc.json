Touch the screen and create beautiful motion of colorful smoke and water!\r\n\r\n\r\nKey features of Magic Fluids:\r\nHighly configurable fluid behaviour and look\r\n10 configuration presets - if you're lazy\r\nYou can save your own presets\r\nMultitouch controls\r\nSmoke and water animation\r\nThousands of particles moving with the fluid\r\nYou can pause the animation anytime and save screenshots\r\nYou can use Magic Fluids as a regular app or as a Live Wallpaper\r\nHighly optimized, multiple quality settings for wide range of devices\r\nPossibilities are endless, effects are fantastic.\r\n\r\nMagic Fluids allows for a great deal of customization. You can modify fluid type, color palette, how long it stays on the screen, when colors should change and much more.\r\n\r\nFluid alone is great, but it only gets better. Turn on particles and watch how they move with the fluid and emphasize it's motion. Particles have lots of configuration options as well - shape, size, color and more. You can have more than 15000 particles on the screen, but you better have a strong device if you want to do that!\r\n\r\nWhatever configuration you come up with, it would be great to save it and use anytime later. That's what user presets are for - you can store ten fluid presets and load them with a single click!\r\n\r\nAre you lazy and don't want to wade through lots of settings? You can use one of ten predefined fluid configurations and still experience a great diversity that Magic Fluids offers! Examples of existing presets are Floating Flames, Wavy Winter or Classy Combination.\r\n\r\nMagic Fluids features two fluid animation methods:\r\nSmoke - classic gas simulation. Smoke is slow and steady. It's great when you want to slow down and relax\r\nWater - uncommon method that makes fluid behaviour more similar to liquid than gas. You can almost feel the pressure propagating through the water while you touch the screen. It's perfect when you want to create dynamic animations and images full of swirls and curls.\r\nWhat's in this version: (Updated : 6 April 2016)\r\nFixing some bugs. Stay tuned for the next update!\r\nRequired Android O/S : 2.2+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d65123d2cad37a8691fe109f4d045c166479ddbc","amp;dn":"Magic+Fluids+v1.5.6+APK+%28Android%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d65123d2cad37a8691fe109f4d045c166479ddbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,81,35,210,202,211,122,134,145,254,16,159,77,4,92,22,100,121,221,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
