Although guitarist Mike Keneally and bassist Scott Thunes are present from Zappa's final touring band (which broke up during the European leg of Zappa's final tour in 1988), Dweezil Zappa (Zappa's talented young son and a fine guitarist in his own right) solos on &quot;Dirty Love,&quot; and former Zappa guitarist Steve Vai makes a guest appearance on &quot;Hot Plate Heaven at the Green Hotel,&quot; Zappa's presence on stage is sorely missed. \r\n\r\nConductor and arranger Joel Thome, who conceived these tribute concerts, is to be congratulated for his efforts, though none of the songs begin to compare with Frank Zappa's own versions, which are readily available on CD. \r\n\r\nThere is also a video version of these concerts that includes music omitted from this CD.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01.
