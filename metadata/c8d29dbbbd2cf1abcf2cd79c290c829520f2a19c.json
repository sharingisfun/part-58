Check my account for more classic bootlegs.\r\n\r\nPlease enjoy, share with friends and please seed :)\r\n\r\n\r\nSantana and Friends Montreux Jazz Festival\r\nMontreux, Switzlerland July 12, 2004\r\n30 minutes PAL format - proshot\r\n1. Opening\r\n2. Santana, Mclaughlin &amp; Nobs chat\r\n3. The Light At The Edge Of The World\r\n4. More talk with Carlos, John &amp; Claude\r\n5. Repetitions (Santana)\r\n6. Buddy Guy with Santana blues jam\r\n7. Jingo (Santana)\r\n8. Hymns For Peace (all star jam)\r\nThe last track features Carlos' band along with:\r\nWayne Shorter - sax\r\nChic Corea - keys\r\nJohn Mclaughlin - guitar\r\nDennis Chambers - drums\r\nHerbie Hancock - keys\r\nRavi Coltrane - clarinette\r\n\r\nMuch of the conversation during the talking portions is \r\nin French.  Carlos, or course, speaks English, but John \r\nand Claude speak in French.  The duet played by Carlos \r\nand John appears to be entirely impromptu - as Carlos was \r\ntold by the MC (who was referring to a guitar), &quot;There is \r\nanother Carlos if you want to play.&quot;  The blues jam with \r\nBuddy Guy is some of the most inspired Santana guitar \r\nplaying I've seen in a long time - really getting back to \r\nhis roots: good, hardcore guitar jamming.  The last tune \r\nhas an all-star cast of musicians, but really mostly \r\nfeatures the Wayne Shorter and Ravi Coltrane.  \r\nJohn Mclaughlin never solos and in fact, he's playing a \r\nsolid body guitar that I'm sure is not one of his guitars.\r\nThe studio portion of the French television show\r\n&quot;Trafic Musique&quot; was filmed on July 22, 2004 and broadcast \r\non August 1, 2004","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8d29dbbbd2cf1abcf2cd79c290c829520f2a19c","amp;dn":"Santana+and+Friends+-+12-07-04+Montreux","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8d29dbbbd2cf1abcf2cd79c290c829520f2a19c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,210,157,187,189,44,241,171,207,44,215,156,41,12,130,149,32,242,161,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
