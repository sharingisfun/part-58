Column Lynch, Foreign Policy\r\nJohn Batchelor May 6 2016 podcast mp3\r\n\r\nâ€¦Top peacekeeping officials recently completed a strategic review that highlights the #Darfur missionâ€™s shortcomings, including a reluctance to confront challenges and a deep pessimism over the missionâ€™s feasibility. Deliberations at the U.N. over its findings come as Foreign Policy has been publishing a trove of internal #UNAMID documents highlighting the blue helmetsâ€™ struggles to protect civilians. But the U.N. Security Council appears unlikely to shutter the $1.3 billion-a-year mission and declare defeat, reasoning that even a weak mission still provides some measure of deterrence against attacks on civilians.\r\n\r\nâ€œRichard Gowan, an expert on U.N. peacekeeping at New York Universityâ€™s Center for International Cooperation, recalled an argument he had with a U.N. official about Darfur. â€œI said this situation has become so bad and in many ways is such a disgrace that this is one case where the U.N. should declare defeat and go home,â€ Gowan said. â€œThe response from the U.N. colleague was that â€˜we would love to declare defeat but we canâ€™t. We have to accept this as a quagmire.â€™ There is a very strong sense within the U.N. that this was a mission that was set up to failâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://foreignpolicy.com/2014/04/07/they-just-stood-watching-2/\r\n \nhttp://foreignpolicy.com/2014/04/08/a-mission-that-was-set-up-to-fail/\r\n \nhttp://foreignpolicy.com/2014/10/29/u-n-whistleblower-decries-cover-up-of-a-cover-up-over-darfur-debacle/\r\n \nhttp://foreignpolicy.com/2014/11/21/see-no-evil-speak-no-evil-u-n-covers-up-sudans-bad-behavior-in-darfur/\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\t\r\n \nhttp://johnbatchelorshow.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9218e8cabd873a6d58b6d097d603e46814605aa7","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+Darfur+Failure.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9218e8cabd873a6d58b6d097d603e46814605aa7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,24,232,202,189,135,58,109,88,182,208,151,214,3,228,104,20,96,90,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
