This was recorded in the cab by a video recorder, through the window of the cab, so if you're used to HD, you won't find it here. There are dead bugs and crap on the windows, for example. However, the quality is pretty good, imo.\r\n\r\nNo music, just the sound of the train and engineer/radio, etc.\r\n\r\nScreenshots: http://imgur.com/a/zmHyH\r\n\r\nCheck my account for other train videos like this, more to come.\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful railway lines in Germany was a regular television program that the night program of the First German Television (ARD)was broadcast.\r\n\r\nThe consignment was not moderated, usually took maximum half an hour and consisted of only a cab ride on railway lines in Germany .Sometimes were entitled The most beautiful railway lines in Europe or the most beautiful train journeys in the world also train routes shown from around the world.
