With Asia's economy and population booming, what changes will Julian detect from previous visits? Julian's journey begins rather inauspiciously in Hong Kong, where he foolishly volunteers to take one of Bruce Lee's famed one-inch punches at a martial arts school. After a sudden necessity to visit the bathroom shortly thereafter, it's at least a lesson learned. In Thailand, Julian tags along with investigative journalists and is recruited as an undercover spy to film an exposÃ© on illegal gambling. Once again Julian finds he might have got himself in a little deeper than he would have liked, another lesson learned. Typically, whenever Julian is involved, there appears to be a pattern forming. Subsequent visits to the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and China also offer lots more education for Julian. Let's just say Julian is a great student of world travel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3)  Philippines \r\nJulian Hanton begins his exploration of the Philippines in its capital Manila where he manages to gain a guest appearance on the country's top TV show, Eat Bulaga. He tries to follow in Imelda Marcos's footsteps and takes a ride in a giant 'shoe car'. Heading north he walks on 1000-year-old rice terraces and tries the Pilipino delicacy Balut, a fertilized duck egg, before flying south to recover on Boracay's white sand beach. Finally he returns to Manila to get some lessons in rhythm from a dancing traffic cop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/34/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b3/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fe/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/59/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/10/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/af/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/ce/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/11/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/97/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cc/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ea/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ac/Asian-Times-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3152 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1024 x 540\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 7\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.01 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.tv.nu/program/asian-times","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b11b17ff085489ffbb5bc9c70434c7cc83da67ad","amp;dn":"Asian+Times+Series+1+3of7+Philippines+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b11b17ff085489ffbb5bc9c70434c7cc83da67ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,27,23,255,8,84,137,255,187,91,201,199,4,52,199,204,131,218,103,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
