It wasn't until 2007 though, when Steen returned to Ring of Honor with El Generico as his partner that he was truly able to display his abilities. Whether it be as part of a duo, or battling in singles competition, Kevin Steen cemented himself as an innovative wrestler, as capable of taking high risks through the air as he was at brawling. Through hard-fought battles, &quot;Mr. Wrestling&quot; earned the respect of the fans and proved himself deserving of that nickname.\r\n\r\nThis collection of 21 matches &amp; highlights puts on display the relentless drive that led Steen to his first championship success in Ring of Honor; from his 2005 debut &amp; never before released 1st ROH battle with El Generico through the battles with The Age of the Fall over the ROH World Tag Titles, this 2-Disc DVD set includes Steen &amp; Generico's wars with The Briscoes, Kevin's bids for the ROH World Title against Morishima &amp; Nigel McGuinness, as well as bouts against the likes of Bryan Danielson, Kenny King, and more!
