This documentary follows three prestigious designers working for some of the capital's wealthiest clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n1)  Joanna Wood \r\nJoanna Wood, who has been designing houses for royal families and Hollywood film stars for 30 years, and Brian Wade, who has spent the past four-and-a-half years designing a seven-storey Knightsbridge townhouse, with furniture including a stingray-skin coffee table and a chandelier made from Hyde Park leaves dipped in gold.\r\n\r\n2)  Aquarium Architecture \r\nAquarium Architecture design bespoke fish tanks for people who want to make a statement and here install one for a wealthy Londoner who wants a tank of predatory fish. Savoir Beds' items are custom-fitted and can cost more than Â£100,000, and Roja Dove charges clients Â£25,000 to create unique fragrances for their homes. Fiona Barrett-Campbell is a leading light in furniture design and along with her husband - former footballer Sol Campbell - is creating a luxury London showroom to showcase her pieces.\r\n\r\n3)  Sally Mackereth \r\nThe peek into the world of luxury interior design focuses on Chelsea, one of London's most exclusive boroughs. Leading architect Sally Mackereth is transforming a former artist's studio into a fully furnished apartment for a luxury developer. Travelling across Europe, she collects and commissions exclusive furniture - from satin wall lining to a table made from 8,000-year old wood - as she tries to appeal to an international buyer interested in Chelsea's artistic heritage. Meanwhile, Russian property investor Julia Solovyev seeks inspiration as she sets out to furnish the Chelsea house of her dreams.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fa/Millionaires-Mansions-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/ff/Millionaires-Mansions-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/db/Millionaires-Mansions-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/29/Millionaires-Mansions-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/38/Millionaires-Mansions-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/02/Millionaires-Mansions-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/14/Millionaires-Mansions-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/21/Millionaires-Mansions-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/46/Millionaires-Mansions-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/76/Millionaires-Mansions-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/36/Millionaires-Mansions-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c4/Millionaires-Mansions-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7a/Millionaires-Mansions-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/10/Millionaires-Mansions-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d1/Millionaires-Mansions-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f5/Millionaires-Mansions-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3150 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 48mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 3\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.04 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/programme/d4k8dz/millionaires-mansions-designing-britains-most-exclusive-homes/episodeguide/series-1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bebbbbd1640a2a622ae641b1988dde72479af7f7","amp;dn":"Ch4+Millionaires+Mansions+Series+1+3of3+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bebbbbd1640a2a622ae641b1988dde72479af7f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,187,187,209,100,10,42,98,42,230,65,177,152,141,222,114,71,154,247,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
