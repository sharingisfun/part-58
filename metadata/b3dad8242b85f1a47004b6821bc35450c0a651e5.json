Coyne lays out in clear, dispassionate detail why the toolkit of science, based on reason and empirical study, is reliable, while that of religionâ€”including faith, dogma, and revelationâ€”leads to incorrect, untestable, or conflicting conclusions.\r\n\r\nCoyne is responding to a national climate in which over half of Americans donâ€™t believe in evolution (and congressmen deny global warming), and warns that religious prejudices and strictures in politics, education, medicine, and social policy are on the rise. Extending the bestselling works of Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, and Christopher Hitchens, he demolishes the claims of religion to provide verifiable â€œtruthâ€ by subjecting those claims to the same tests we use to establish truth in science.\r\n\r\nCoyne irrefutably demonstrates the grave harmâ€”to individuals and to our planetâ€”in mistaking faith for fact in making the most important decisions about the world we live in","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3dad8242b85f1a47004b6821bc35450c0a651e5","amp;dn":"Faith+Versus+Fact+-+Jerry+A.+Coyne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3dad8242b85f1a47004b6821bc35450c0a651e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,218,216,36,43,133,241,164,112,4,182,130,27,195,84,80,192,166,81,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
