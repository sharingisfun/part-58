Republicans 1237 First Ballot Delegates. David Drucker, Washington Examiner. Larry Johnson, No Quarter, Thaddeus McCotter WJR.\r\n\r\n&quot;Way back in 1980, when Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush were running for president, Bush heralded his Iowa victory by declaring he had &quot;the Big Mo&quot; -- momentum -- that would carry him to the presidency.\r\n\r\n&quot;Other states and the math intervened, and he became Reagan's vice president instead.\r\n\r\nBernie Sanders is talking a lot about the Big Mo after his victories in five western states. If I were in his position, I would probably be doing the same thing. It helps him raise money and continue the battle for the next several months.\r\n\r\n&quot;But Hillary's sweep of five major states on March 15th wasn't exactly chopped liver either, nor were her overwhelming wins in southern states. The difference is that Hillary has been racking up the delegates. The math is on her side...&quot;\r\n \nhttp://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/peter-fenn/articles/2016-03-28/math-matters-more-than-momentum-in-bernies-odds-to-win-democratic-primary\r\n\r\n_____________\r\n\r\nEmail from the Clinton Campaign:\r\n\r\nJohn --\r\n\r\nI want to let you know about a development that just occurred, because it matters. The tone of this primary matters, and the condition of our party at the end of it will matter as we prepare to face Donald Trump or Ted Cruz this fall.\r\n\r\nEarlier today, the Sanders campaign wrote a letter to the Democratic National Committee, falsely accusing us of violating campaign finance law.\r\n\r\nYou wonâ€™t be surprised by what happened next: 26 minutes after the letter was sent, his campaign sent a fundraising email attempting to capitalize on the phony charges.\r\n\r\n(Before you read any further, let's get one thing straight: this accusation is false. They're questioning our joint fundraising agreement with the DNC, which allows us to support Democrats running up and down the ticket -- the same fundraising structure used by President Obama in 2008 and 2012.)\r\n\r\nThis latest incident is part of a troubling pattern of behavior -- occurring just as Bernieâ€™s mathematical odds of winning the nomination dwindle toward zero -- in which Sanders and his team are not just debating us on issues (which we all agree is perfectly fair), but rather attacking Hillary Clintonâ€™s character, integrity, and motivations.\r\n\r\nThe fact that they include the Democratic Party in these charges -- an organization we want future generations of progressives to trust and support -- further confirms that the Sanders campaign has let things get out of hand in its waning days. To wit:\r\n\r\nâ€¢\tOver the weekend, they had protesters outside one of our fundraising events -- one whose proceeds went not just to Hillary for America, but to the Democratic National Committee and 32 state Democratic Parties -- throwing dollar bills at Hillaryâ€™s motorcade, as if they were at, shall we say, an adult entertainment venue. This was just days after someone introducing Bernie at a rally called Hillary a â€œDemocratic whore.â€\r\n\r\nâ€¢\tIn last weekâ€™s debate, Bernie questioned Hillaryâ€™s commitment to fighting climate change because a whopping 0.2% of the money given to our campaign has come from employees of oil and gas companies. Not even 2%, mind you: 0.2%.\r\n\r\nâ€¢\tAnd of course, Sanders spent several days calling Hillary unqualified for the presidency, based on an entirely false claim that Hillary had said the same about him. She hadnâ€™t (and still hasnâ€™t, even after what he said).\r\n\r\nTo be clear, we welcome a debate on the important issues facing Americans, like how to prevent gun violence, encourage tolerance, and do more to level the playing field for Americans who are counting on us.\r\n\r\nBut itâ€™s hard to see how anyone -- other than Donald Trump and Ted Cruz -- benefits from this downward spiral of irresponsible and baseless attacks. Right about now is when we ought to be talking about coming together as a progressive movement, not undermining a generation of votersâ€™ faith in the Democratic Party and in the woman who is almost certain to be its nominee.\r\n\r\nThank you for everything you do to support our campaign.\r\n\r\nRobby\r\n\r\nRobby Mook\r\n\r\nCampaign Manager\r\n\r\nHillary for America\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\t\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f856cc235358e1c971f6f50c48b429b401cdc02","amp;dn":"John-Batchelor-sanders-trump-ticket.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f856cc235358e1c971f6f50c48b429b401cdc02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,133,108,194,53,53,142,28,151,31,111,80,196,139,66,155,64,28,220,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
