I've personally tested in P3D v3.1 and everything works 100 percent.   Installer requires no crack or reg fix, simply run the .exe and select your sim platform.   Recommend that you fully uninstall any previous Milviz F-4E versions beforehand by re-running whatever Milviz F-4 installer you originally used and selecting the 'uninstall' option.    \r\n\r\n*DISCLAIMER*: I take zero credit for this.    All thanks go to the original uploader/cracker from 'elsewhere'.    I'm simply passing this along (sharing is caring.)   :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25fb0f24046e7f805938aaf4f3aae9e7ddee3bb4","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%2FP3D%5D+Milviz+F-4E+Phantom+II+v1.160114+for+FSX%2FFSX-SE%2FP3D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25fb0f24046e7f805938aaf4f3aae9e7ddee3bb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,251,15,36,4,110,127,128,89,56,170,244,243,170,233,231,221,238,59,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
