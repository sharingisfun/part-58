When Thelma and Louise ran away, they were fleeing their boring lives, but at least they had cash in the bank. When the heroine of A Blast, Maria, runs away she's fleeing the suffering imposed on her by a global economic crisis that has hit the world hard, and her country, Greece, perhaps hardest. It is a crisis which has forced people everywhere to re-evaluate downwards their expectations of the world, but Maria's having none of that. She wants out, and A Blast, Syllas Tzoumerkas's second film, is the frantic, unsettling and intriguing record of her journey, a journey more emotional than literal. The watching viewer is strapped in beside her, along for the ride, hair blown back.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: MPEG4 Video (H264), 720x428, 24.000 fps, 1624 Kbps, 01h23m03s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, Greek audio with some English and German\r\n\r\nOptional subtitles English, Russian, Serbian\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/cnl4j1xfn/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/li0x7g1q9/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ve20737i9/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/54gxoalkx/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/mt8ofwxc1/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06aef48de3241ff3f37533d6329e85fdd2746d70","amp;dn":"A+Blast+-+I+ekrixi+%282014+-+Greece%29+%5Bsubtitles%5D+thriller","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06aef48de3241ff3f37533d6329e85fdd2746d70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,174,244,141,227,36,31,243,243,117,51,214,50,158,133,253,210,116,109,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
