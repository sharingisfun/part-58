Eugene-Richard Gasana, Rwanda Ambassador to the UN. Ilan Berman, AFPC.\r\n\r\nâ€œAzerbaijan and Armenia on Thursday accused each other of violating a two-day-old cease-fire in Nagorno-Karabakh, while Russia and Iran joined diplomatic efforts to prevent a war that could destabilize the strategic Caucasus region.\r\n\r\nâ€œAzerbaijan's Defense Ministry said its troops returned fire after Armenian forces fired mortars and large-caliber machine guns at Azerbaijani military positions and populated areas. The Armenian side accused Azerbaijan of shelling its positions.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe intense skirmishes have threatened to derail the Russia-brokered cease-fire declared at midday Tuesday following the worst violence since a separatist war ended in 1994. That conflict left Nagorno-Karabakh, officially a part of Azerbaijan, under the control of local ethnic Armenian forces and the Armenian military. Armenian forces also occupy several areas outside the Karabakh region.\r\n \nhttp://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/russia-iran-join-talks-nagorno-karabakh-conflict-38213578\r\n \nhttp://www.reuters.com/article/us-nagorno-karabakh-azerbaijan-idUSKCN0X40WF\r\n\r\nâ€¢ http://www.wsj.com/articles/azerbaijan-armenia-cease-fire-over-nagorno-karabakh-1459861704\r\n\r\nâ€¢ http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18270325\r\n\r\nâ€¢ http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35970303\r\n\r\nâ€¢ http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35967606\r\n \nhttp://foreignpolicy.com/2016/03/28/how-happy-is-the-one-who-says-i-am-a-turk/\r\n\r\nâ€¢ http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/is-armenia-the-next-turkish-russian-flashpoint\r\n\r\nâ€¢ http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35967351\r\n\r\nâ€¢ http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35973860\r\n \nhttp://www.ibtimes.com/rwandan-genocide-anniversary-facts-about-mass-slaughter-between-hutus-tutsi-2349812\r\n\r\nâ€¢ http://www.nationalreview.com/article/433574/iran-sanctions-relief-economic-concessions-united-states-market\r\n\r\nâ€¢ http://www.nationalinterest.org/feature/why-russia-claiming-victory-syria-15587","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43cbf3c35a3346d97a6d7100946ea487408fbb72","amp;dn":"johnbatchelor-azerbaijan-conflict-turkey-tutsi-genocide.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43cbf3c35a3346d97a6d7100946ea487408fbb72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,203,243,195,90,51,70,217,122,109,113,0,148,110,164,135,64,143,187,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
