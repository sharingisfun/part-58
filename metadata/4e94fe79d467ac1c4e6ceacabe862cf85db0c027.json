Washingtoâ€œHeâ€™s certainly a capable guy,â€ the presumptive GOP presidential nominee added. &quot;Itâ€™s something we can think about.â€\r\n\r\nTrump defeated Cruz in Tuesdayâ€™s Indiana GOP presidential primary, making him the presumptive nominee.\r\n\r\nCruz suspended his Oval Office bid shortly afterward, saying that his results in the Hoosier State â€œforecloseâ€ his path to the Republican presidential nomination.\r\n\r\nTrump on Wednesday said that he does not resent Cruz for their often bitter contest against each another.\r\n\r\nâ€œItâ€™s an easy thing,â€ he said of the nominating process. &quot;He said some things and he made some things up and he took some things that were said out of context.â€\r\n\r\nReports emerged earlier on Wednesday that retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson would serve on a selection committee for finding Trumpâ€™s running mate.\r\n\r\nCarson, another former GOP presidential candidate, will help Trump make his pick before the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July.\r\n\r\nTrump on Wednesday said that Carsonâ€™s involvement stems from his reluctance in becoming the vice presidential nominee himself.\r\n\r\nâ€œI donâ€™t think Benâ€™s looking at that,â€ he said. &quot;Heâ€™s a friend of mine. Heâ€™s been so helpful.
