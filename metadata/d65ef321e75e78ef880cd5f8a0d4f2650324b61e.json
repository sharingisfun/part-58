Nelson Schwartz, NYT. Patrick Tucker, Defense One. Oriana Pawlyk, Air Force Times.\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦In joining his fellow Texan Representative Jeb Hensarling in trying to block the reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank, Cruz landed on the perfect vehicle to drive his charge against â€œcrony capitalism.â€ The Ex-Im Bank is a government agency established in 1934 to help facilitate U.S. exports. Congressional reauthorization of the organization was not controversial. In other words, it was a blank canvas on which Cruz and Hensarling could paint what they liked.\r\n\r\nâ€œIn launching his opposition, Cruz admitted as much, saying in an op-ed in USA Today, â€œTo most Americans, the words â€œExport-Import Bank donâ€™t mean very much.â€ He then fired a lopsided barrage against the bank, describing it as â€œbig businessesâ€™ big government bank backed by U.S. taxpayers.â€ He cites numerous examples of the bank financing projects in countries with unfriendly or corrupt regimes, such as China and Congo, and describing its practices as â€œmarkedly irresponsible.â€\r\n\r\nSome of Cruzâ€™ criticisms are accurate. There have been charges of corruption, and like most federal institutions, the bank is not well run. However, for all the shortcomings, Ex-Im has operated since its founding with a default rate of 1 percent and, nearly alone among government agencies, the bank turns a profit. It contributed $674 million to taxpayers in 2014 and $432 million in 2015.\r\n\r\nâ€œMore important, the bank provides loans and loan guarantees to entities wishing to buy U.S.-made goods that otherwise would not be able to access credit to do so. That is why operations in places like Sudan and Russia are on the list.\r\n \nhttp://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2016/04/06/Not-Solution-Time-Draft-Moderate","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d65ef321e75e78ef880cd5f8a0d4f2650324b61e","amp;dn":"john-batchelor-trump-cruz-new-york-city-pov-cybercommand.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d65ef321e75e78ef880cd5f8a0d4f2650324b61e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,94,243,33,231,94,120,239,136,12,213,248,160,212,242,101,3,36,182,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
