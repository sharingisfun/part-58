Based on the classic game of Snake, play as an adventurer exploring ancient temple ruins and collect valuable treasure! Collecting at least 40 pieces of treasure will open up exit stairs to move onto the next level. Each new level becomes larger and more dangerous, as spiked traps and snake pits appear. As the adventurer continues the journey into the depths, more obstacles will appear to make treasure hunting harder.\r\n\r\n\r\nVisit their Patreon atto support the indie start-up company.\r\nVisit http://busgasexplosion.com/ for more details and to provide feedback.\r\nVisit https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.busgasexplosion.lootlootfree for more recent updates","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:015dfb72357afa36b8f29674418170fbc3fd34eb","amp;dn":"LootLoot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"015dfb72357afa36b8f29674418170fbc3fd34eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,93,251,114,53,122,250,54,184,242,150,116,65,129,112,251,195,253,52,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
