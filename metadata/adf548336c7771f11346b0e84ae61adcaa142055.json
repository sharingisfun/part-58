Heller (Wiley-VCH, 2003).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 3-527-30309-X\r\n\r\nClarifying the unsolved aspects of labeling novel foods, this book presents the methods, limitations and future perspectives for genetic engineering. Following an overview of recent techniques and applications in plants, animals and microorganisms, a second section - written by expert lawyers - covers the legal issues of genetically engineered food and labeling. The whole is rounded off with methods and strategies for detecting genetic manipulation in food. It is indispensable for industry and laboratories working in food production","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:adf548336c7771f11346b0e84ae61adcaa142055","amp;dn":"Genetically+Engineered+Food+-+Methods+and+Detection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"adf548336c7771f11346b0e84ae61adcaa142055","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,245,72,51,108,119,113,241,19,70,176,232,74,230,26,220,170,20,32,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
