All 4 videos are in this torrent.\r\n\r\nm4v format \r\n\r\n750 x 570 format\r\n\r\neach video @ 1:10:00 min.\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nJust 5 hours of a freight train slowing moving through the Australian Outback. \r\n\r\nNot HD! This was recorded in the cab by a video recorder, through the window of the cab, so if you're used to HD, you won't find it here. There are dead bugs and crap on the windows, for example. However, the quality is pretty good, imo.\r\n\r\nNo music, just the sound of the train and engineer/radio, etc.\r\n\r\nScreenshots: http://imgur.com/a/CWK5Y\r\n\r\nCheck my account for other train videos like this, many more to come","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b27dab54232093ec9aca683bcf4758e718592aa","amp;dn":"Train+Journey+from+the+Drivers+Eye+View+-+Australia+-+4+vids","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b27dab54232093ec9aca683bcf4758e718592aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,39,218,181,66,50,9,62,201,172,166,131,188,244,117,142,113,133,146,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
