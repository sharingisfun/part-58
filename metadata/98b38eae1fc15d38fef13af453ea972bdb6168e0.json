That may well be so now but, if you have talked with some of the captains of the earlier versions of those â€˜boatsâ€™ or read this book, you will soon learn that was not always so. The author graduated from diesel subs and then served on and commanded a number of nuclear boats from 1958 to 1965. Among his many adventures was the first underwaterâ€•and largely under iceâ€•transit of the #NorthwestPassage aboard â€˜#USSSeadragonâ€™. They were pioneering days and a spirit of adventure prevailed. McLaren and his colleagues were explorers at heart and the new technology enabled them to go, as they say, where â€˜no man had gone before.â€™ In an unpretentious, almost laconic, way he weaves a vivid and fascinating tale of those early days when the nuclear learning curve was so steep. A delightful, informative and educational tale.â€â€•Baird Maritime.com\r\n\r\nâ€œSilent and Unseen is a very enjoyable book. By reading this book, young officers can gain more realistic knowledge of submarine service and understand more clearly how important our modern nuclear submarines are to the safety of our country.â€â€•The Daybook, Hampton Roads Naval Museum\r\n\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98b38eae1fc15d38fef13af453ea972bdb6168e0","amp;dn":"Attack+Submarines+Cold+War+Book+Review+John+Batchelor+05062016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98b38eae1fc15d38fef13af453ea972bdb6168e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,179,142,174,31,193,93,56,254,241,58,244,83,234,151,43,219,97,104,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
