Since publishing in 1984, Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry (CHEC) has become the standard work on the subject, indispensable to all serious readers in the interdisciplinary areas where heterocycles are employed. CHEC-III builds on and complements the material in CHEC and CHEC-II and is designed to be used both alone and in conjunction with these two works. Written by leading scientists who have evaluated and summarized the most important data published over the last decade, Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry III will be an invaluable addition to the reference library of those working with heterocyclic ring systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nAudience\r\nFor academic, industrial and government scientists working in chemical, biological, pharaceutical, medicinal and natural product research, together with teachers and advanced students interested in the formation (synthesis) and transformation of heterocyclic ring systems","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10726a9afcbbba9c84edbfc5b54ee75ce01c837c","amp;dn":"Comprehensive+Heterocyclic+Chemistry+%5BI-III%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10726a9afcbbba9c84edbfc5b54ee75ce01c837c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,114,106,154,252,187,186,156,132,237,191,197,181,78,231,92,224,28,131,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
