This greatly enhances immersion and drivability. It's a great companion to our already immersive motion simuators but can be applied to motionless simulators as well","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:67d86afd9646614daceb7861cf7988bafcf4fe46","amp;dn":"Simvibe+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"67d86afd9646614daceb7861cf7988bafcf4fe46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,216,106,253,150,70,97,77,172,235,120,97,207,121,136,186,252,244,254,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
