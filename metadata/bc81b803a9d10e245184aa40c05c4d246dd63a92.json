In this sweeping narrative, Sheehan brings to life a huge cast of some of the most intriguing characters of the cold war, including the brilliant physicist John Von Neumann, and the hawkish Air Force general, Curtis LeMay. Melding biography, history, world affairs, and science, A Fiery Peace in a Cold War transports the reader back and forth from individual drama to world stage.\r\n\r\n------------\r\ncribbing notoriously from other user uploads, here wrapped in one is the book in epub &amp; azw3 (thanks to jpmrb) and an audio book version (from sstimefill)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc81b803a9d10e245184aa40c05c4d246dd63a92","amp;dn":"A+Fiery+Peace+in+a+Cold+War+%5E+Neil+Sheehan+%5E+audio+%26amp%3B+etext","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc81b803a9d10e245184aa40c05c4d246dd63a92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,129,184,3,169,209,14,36,81,132,170,64,192,92,77,36,109,214,58,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
