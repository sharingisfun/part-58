I still canâ€™t take the Vermont Socialist himself seriously, not with Larry David as his doppelgÃ¤nger. But the Sanders phenomenonâ€”embraced by a strong majority of liberals between the ages of 17 and 50â€”deserves attention.\r\n\r\nReporters have exhaustively plumbed the habitats and mental states of â€œthe Trump voter.â€ Sen. Sandersâ€™s supporters, by contrast, have floated through the primaries in a mist of keywordsâ€”millennials, college students, young professionals, actresses, â€œwhite people.â€\r\n\r\nOne has to ask: Are they all actually socialists? I doubt it.\r\n\r\nItâ€™s no surprise Donald Trump in his New York victory speech about the â€œcorruptâ€ Republican Party called Sen. Sanders a fellow â€œoutsider.â€ The two great disrupters are remarkably similar, a kind of Tweedledon and Tweedleburn on trade and a â€œsystemâ€ thatâ€™s â€œbrokenâ€ and â€œfailingâ€ their supporters.\r\n \nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/bernie-sanderss-legacy-1461194181?tesla=y\r\n\r\n________________\r\n\r\nâ€œThe many divisions should not surprise us, as we are in the midst of a transition from the post-World War II bipolar world to something else, something as yet unclear. In part, it is a return to historic normalcy, although few who grew up during the Cold War would recognize it as such. The post-war world, for roughly a half-century after the defeat of Germany and Japan, was unusually peaceful compared with past centuries. From 1945 until very recently, there was no major war, and â€œstabilityâ€ was considered a fundamental objective of sensible strategy. Three or four generations have grown up in that world, and are surprised at open conflict and instability.\r\n\r\nâ€œThis bespeaks ignorance of the past. Americans have long been unique in believing that peace is the normal condition of mankind. The opposite is true. Most of human history, including our own, is the story of war, the consequences of wars, and preparations for war. The United States fought two world wars in the twentieth century, a very bloody civil war in the 19th, and a revolutionary war in the 18th. Our recent pastâ€”fifty years without a major warâ€“is most unusual. It was primarily the result of the exercise of American and Soviet power, paradoxically two revolutionary countries, insisting on an uneasy standoff.\r\n\r\nâ€œWe are now returning to a more violent normalcy, where peace is rare and stability most unlikely. The two superpowers that dominated the post-war period are now absent; the Soviet Union is gone, and the United States has abandoned its global missionâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelledeen/2016/04/01/the-whole-world-is-in-turmoil-not-just-us/#76ededb69c51\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:285ccf95e0d2509ec0aea0f0dcffca794277f82f","amp;dn":"Is-Sanders-Future-Democrats-Been-Waiting-For.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"285ccf95e0d2509ec0aea0f0dcffca794277f82f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,92,207,149,224,210,80,158,192,174,160,240,220,255,202,121,66,119,248,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
