If your coming from RC1, you will need to reimage the drive. Update packages wont be available until the first official release.\r\n1.) Download the Torrent\r\n2.) Unrar the disk image and write it to your HDD/SDD using something capable of handeling raw disk images. Such as &quot;dd&quot; that you find in Linux.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you wish to add other/different games.\r\n\r\n1.) Place all your games into seperate folders on third partition ( labeled &quot;TTXMulti[Games]&quot; ). For example lets say you wanted to put King of Fighters XIII on the multi. You would create a folder named &quot;King of Fighters XIII&quot; on the third partition ( labeled &quot;TTXMulti[Games]&quot; ) then place all the game files into your newly created &quot;King of Fighters XIII&quot; folder.\r\n2.) Once you have your games added to the multi, unmount the drive, connect it to your TypeX2 and enjoy :).\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshot: \nhttp://i.imgur.com/h01BGyi.jpg\r\n\r\nGames Included:\r\n\r\nBattleFantasia\r\nBlazBlue CalamityTrigger\r\nBlazBlue ContinuumShift\r\nChaos Breaker\r\nGigaWing Generations\r\nHomura\r\nKing of Fighters 98 Ultimate Match\r\nKing of Fighters Maximum Impact Regulation A\r\nKing of Fighters SkyStage\r\nKing of Fighters XII\r\nKing of Fighters XIII\r\nPowerInstinct 5\r\nRaiden 3\r\nRaiden 4\r\nSamuraiSpirits Sen\r\nSenko no Ronde Duo\r\nShikigami 3\r\nSpica Adventure\r\nStreetFighter 4\r\nStreetFighter 4 Arcade Edition\r\nStreetFighter 4 Arcade Edition Export\r\nSuper StreetFighter 4 Arcade Edition 2012\r\nTrouble Witches","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8cc397d2cba021ead8ab9611fc789b3b018ece8","amp;dn":"Taito+TypeX2+Multi+%5BRC2%5D+with+23+Games%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8cc397d2cba021ead8ab9611fc789b3b018ece8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,204,57,125,44,186,2,30,173,138,185,97,31,199,137,179,176,24,236,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
