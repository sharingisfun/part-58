There are no better quality rips of Futurama out there.  These are all hevc h.265.  Seasons 1 through 4 are ripped from the DVDs, Season 6 and 7 are from the BluRays.  The files are all named based on AVC production order.  This means they are in the correct (non-broadcast) order.  It also means they are NOT in DVD order, in that DVD order dictates that Season 6 is actually seasons 5 and 6, and season 7 is actually season 7 and 8.  If you don't like production order, rename the files.  All original audio and subtitle tracks are included.\r\n\r\nI will also be posting a complete set of rips of the Futurama movies soon","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:358845bc041087bd4d2c201f4bebdbfa1393ca30","amp;dn":"Futurama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"358845bc041087bd4d2c201f4bebdbfa1393ca30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,136,69,188,4,16,135,189,77,44,32,31,75,235,219,250,19,147,202,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
