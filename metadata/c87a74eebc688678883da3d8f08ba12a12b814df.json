Many may know of the satanic &quot;all-seeing eye&quot;, the golden calf or apis  bull, and other symbolism, but where did they originate and what god do they represent?  This short video provides good insight of the spiritual battle (as satan esteems himself to &quot;be like the most high&quot;) that the modern world now faces.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe Watchman America Israel and Bible Prophecy, 2-18- 2014:\r\nThe Wathcman details the latest modern events are spiraling out of control setting up the prophesied wars in the Middle East and ushering the End of Days.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe gods of Babylon:\r\nThe for the ancient city of Babylon as the birth place of a mystery religion which has survived to the present day and is deceiving the whole world. In this presentation we examine the origins of this mystery religion and see how it survives and thrives in the form of secret symbols and false systems of worship. See how this ancient mystery religion reveals the identity of the Antichrist power that is alive and well in the world today and which is directing world events for its own purposes. Will you be deceived into receiving &quot;the mark of the beast&quot;? Watch this presentation and arm yourself with the truth so that you will not be deceived!\r\n\r\nAlso learn what the Bible reveals about the nature of God? Is God a mysterious unity of three co-equal and co-eternal Persons as most Christians believe? Who or what is the Holy Spirit? Is there is a reason why there is so much confusion about the nature and identity of the Holy Spirit? Is our God the Author of confusion? Or is it possible instead that most Christians have simply been deceived about the nature of God having its origins tied to ancient pagan mysticism and not the Bible?\r\n\r\nDiscover the knowledge of man being made in God's image and how it clearly reveals His loving nature. The bible makes it easy to understand, but man has turned God's nature into something mysterious and confusing. Either misinterpreting or misrepresenting God's truth, man has continued to cling to the teachings of Tradition rather than accept these simple truths contained in the Bible.\r\n\r\nAs Christians, we must accept God for who He is: a loving and righteous, eternal and everlasting God. In turn, we must accept the bible as His holy word containing all truth for us to learn and grow in His holy image. It must be Sola Scriptura with no adding or deleting of God's truths in scripture. The wise must be prudent in understanding these details and not let themselves be deceived by the pagan traditions embraced by the church which is leading the world into the end of days.\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhat Jesus Said About Baptism:\r\nWhat is baptism and why is it important?
