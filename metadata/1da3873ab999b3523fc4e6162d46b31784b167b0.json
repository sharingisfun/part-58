Kyle Jahner, Army Times.\r\n\r\nâ€œNearly one in five of the Air Force's remotely piloted aircraft missions against the Islamic State involves strikes against the militants, according to Air Forces Central Command.\r\n\r\nâ€œMQ-1 Predators and MQ-9 Reapers, armed with Hellfire missiles, have flown a third of the Air Force's sorties against Islamic State militants since the start of Operation Inherent Resolve, providing intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance. The unmanned aircraft have hit ISIS targets on 17 percent of those sorties, according to AFCENT statistics provided to Air Force Timesâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.airforcetimes.com/story/military/2016/03/30/isis-kill-missions-1-5-conducted-drone/82389432/\r\n\r\n________\r\n \nhttp://www.airforcetimes.com/story/military/2016/03/24/air-force-f-16s-fly-most-sorties-against-isis-b-1s-drop-most-bombs/82212394/\r\n\r\n_____\r\n \nhttp://www.airforcetimes.com/story/military/2016/03/26/air-force-loans-bombs-coalition-partners-war-isis/82219174/\r\n\r\n___________\r\n\r\n&quot;Why the Military Can't Go After Iran for Hacking Your Dam&quot;: Patrick Tucker reports that seven Iranians have been charged with cyber crimes in a case that reveals the limits of U.S. power. The indictment doesn't say whether the Justice Department believes the intrusion was simple reconnaissance or, more darkly, part of a dramatic cyber-physical attack that didn't go off as planned. That ambiguity is common in cases involving hacks by groups connected to states like Iran. Figuring out who ordered the probe and what the attacks actual objective would be key to any military response, which is why we shouldn't expect one.\r\n \nhttp://www.defenseone.com/technology/2016/03/why-military-cant-go-after-iran-hacking-your-dam/126945/?oref=d-river\r\n\r\n_________\r\n\r\nThe StingRay is a suitcase-size device that tricks phones into giving up their serial numbers (and, often, their phone calls and texts) by pretending to be a cell phone tower. Typically used by military, intelligence officials, and police, they are now cheaper and easier to make than everâ€”and in the coming age of democratized surveillance, the person hacking into your cell phone might not be the police or the FBI. It could be your next-door neighbor. Interviewing key technologists and privacy activists, Robert Kolker investigates the ongoing scrum over cell phone privacy and the regulation of telecommunications surveillance, as well as the vulnerabilities in the networks that make it possible.\r\n \nhttp://buswk.co/StingRay\r\n\r\n__________\r\n \nhttp://www.armytimes.com/story/military/2016/03/27/army-chief-you-want-new-pistol-send-me-cabelas-17-million/82132450/?from=global&amp;sessionKey=&amp;autologin=\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\t\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1da3873ab999b3523fc4e6162d46b31784b167b0","amp;dn":"JohnBatchelor-usaf-vs-isis-cyber--no-mobile-is-secure.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1da3873ab999b3523fc4e6162d46b31784b167b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,163,135,58,185,153,179,82,63,196,230,22,45,70,179,23,132,177,103,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
