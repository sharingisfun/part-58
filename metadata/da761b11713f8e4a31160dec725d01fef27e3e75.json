It was released as a follow-up to the band's previous compilation, The Singles 81â†’85, which was also re-released in the same year. The compilation covers the band's 7-inch single releases spanning five studio albums (from 1986's Black Celebration to 1997's Ultra), as well as including the band's 1998 stand-alone single &quot;Only When I Lose Myself&quot;. Also included is &quot;Little 15&quot; (from Music for the Masses, released as a single in Europe), and the live version of &quot;Everything Counts&quot; (from the live album 101) which was released as a single in 1989. All tracks on The Singles 86&gt;98 were newly remastered, as was the case with the re-release of The Singles 81â†’85.\r\n\r\nThe four-month Singles Tour that followed marked the first time Depeche Mode had toured since the 1993â€“94 Devotional/Exotic Tour.
