Youâ€™ll also learn how to navigate the fifteen most common fights couples have, including â€œthe blame game,â€ â€œdueling over dollars,â€ â€œIf you really loved me, youâ€™dâ€¦,â€ â€œtold-you-soâ€™s,â€ and more.\r\n\r\nIf youâ€™re ready to start fighting for your love, rather than against it, this book will show you how","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41e80d6bbbacd93b17470f86c0ed227b0ceb68d6","amp;dn":"The+Heart+of+the+Fight+-+Judith+Wright","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41e80d6bbbacd93b17470f86c0ed227b0ceb68d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,232,13,107,187,172,217,59,23,71,15,134,192,237,34,123,12,235,104,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
