It prints plainly ludicrous stories, such as a double-decker London bus being found frozen in the Antarctic ice, or a World War II bomber found on the moon. Defenders of the paper pointed out that it was not intended to be taken seriously. Its controversial content also includes a high quotient of softcore female nudity and extensive advertising for sexual services.\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday Sport â€“ 14 February 2016\r\nEnglish | PDF | 64 pages | 56,34 MB[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69b2121a3c58d006f2a1b0885703619133076864","amp;dn":"Sunday+Sport+%26ndash%3B+14+February+2016%5Bby+robert%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69b2121a3c58d006f2a1b0885703619133076864","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,178,18,26,60,88,208,6,242,161,176,136,87,3,97,145,51,7,104,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
