A blue-collar family living the idyllic rural lifestyle. Nothing is out of place save for the lacking white picket fence - and the old JAIL that occupies the 2nd floor of their century-old home. Seth Delray knew the possibilities before he moved his wife and two kids into the old jailhouse, but the Sheriff assured him that it would take an act of God to put that place back into service. Times were tight, and it was just too good of a deal to refuse. That is, until the county jail caught fire. The Sheriff's hands were tied and he had to put displaced inmates anywhere he could find iron bars with a locking door. The Delray house was his only option. For Seth the worst wasn't the criminals locked like animals in the soiled cages above his living room. It was the mortal fear in his children's eyes, it was the piercing cold looks from his wife. It was that deep, dark creeping recognition that something had happened there, something terrible, something that would grip his soul with hundred year old hands squeezing hate from unknown depths. No longer did the birds sing upon the morning lit branches beyond the barred windows of the old jailhouse. No one could know the confinement of such a place and the horror it brings... the bleak hopelessness of one without freedom... ...the inescapable iron bars of guilt and regret into which revenge imprisons a man's mind. \r\n\r\nEnjoy and seed!\r\nRR\r\n\r\nScreencaps:  http://i.imgur.com/4MaKNLL.jpg\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nID                                       : 1\r\nFormat                                   : AVC\r\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec\r\nFormat profile                           :   \r\nFormat settings, CABAC                   : Yes\r\nFormat settings, ReFrames                : 4 frames\r\nCodec ID                                 : avc1\r\nCodec ID/Info                            : Advanced Video Coding\r\nDuration                                 : 1h 26mn\r\nBit rate                                 : 5 890 Kbps\r\nWidth                                    : 1 920 pixels\r\nHeight                                   : 1 080 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode                          : Constant\r\nFrame rate                               : 23.976 (24000/1001) fps\r\nColor space                              : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\r\nScan type                                : Progressive\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.118\r\nStream size                              : 3.55 GiB (96%)\r\nWriting library                          : x264 core 138 r2358 9e941d1\r\nEncoding settings                        : cabac=1 / ref=3 / deblock=1:0:0 / analyse=0x3:0x113 / me=hex / subme=7 / psy=1 / psy_rd=1.00:0.00 / mixed_ref=1 / me_range=16 / chroma_me=1 / trellis=1 / 8x8dct=1 / cqm=0 / deadzone=21,11 / fast_pskip=1 / chroma_qp_offset=-2 / threads=12 / lookahead_threads=2 / sliced_threads=0 / nr=0 / decimate=1 / interlaced=0 / bluray_compat=0 / stitchable=1 / constrained_intra=0 / bframes=3 / b_pyramid=2 / b_adapt=1 / b_bias=0 / direct=1 / weightb=1 / open_gop=0 / weightp=2 / keyint=72 / keyint_min=24 / scenecut=40 / intra_refresh=0 / rc_lookahead=40 / rc=2pass / mbtree=1 / bitrate=5890 / ratetol=1.0 / qcomp=0.60 / qpmin=5 / qpmax=69 / qpstep=4 / cplxblur=20.0 / qblur=0.5 / vbv_maxrate=6750 / vbv_bufsize=22500 / nal_hrd=none / ip_ratio=1.40 / aq=1:1.00\r\nEncoded date                             : UTC 2013-12-21 02:37:26\r\nTagged date                              : UTC 2013-12-21 02:37:26\r\nColor range                              : Limited\r\nColor primaries                          : BT.709\r\nTransfer characteristics                 : BT.709\r\nMatrix coefficients                      : BT.709\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nID                                       : 2\r\nFormat                                   : AAC\r\nFormat/Info                              : Advanced Audio Codec\r\nFormat profile                           : LC\r\nCodec ID                                 : 40\r\nDuration                                 : 1h 26mn\r\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\r\nBit rate                                 : 256 Kbps\r\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\r\nFrame rate                               : 46.875 fps (1024 spf)\r\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\r\nStream size                              : 158 MiB (4%)\r\nEncoded date                             : UTC 2013-12-21 02:37:26\r\nTagged date                              : UTC 2013-12-21 02:37:26","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:409df2b8eb65fc40e5de0f537498aa1e7133352a","amp;dn":"The+Jailhouse.2009.WEBRip.RR.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"409df2b8eb65fc40e5de0f537498aa1e7133352a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,157,242,184,235,101,252,64,229,222,15,83,116,152,170,30,113,51,53,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
