It added that the fate of the 30 is unknown.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe ISIS-affiliated Aamaq news agency said most of the 300 were released after questioning to determine their religion and whether they support the government. It said four workers who belonged to the minority Druze sect were killed and 20 pro-government gunmen are still being held.\r\n \nhttp://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/1.713563\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bb26b8a0f1dec33b6d714b9a9aab1c84dec5baf","amp;dn":"John-Batchelor-risk-of-the-druze-in-the-syrian-war.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bb26b8a0f1dec33b6d714b9a9aab1c84dec5baf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,178,107,138,15,29,236,51,182,215,20,185,169,170,177,200,77,236,91,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
