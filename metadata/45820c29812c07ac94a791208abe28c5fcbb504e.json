New users are recommended to try 702, existing users do not need to upgrade unless they have problems that have been addressed in this thread prior to 702 release. The &quot;fatdog-update&quot; packages will continue to be refreshed and should be applicable to both 700, 701 and 702 for foreseeable future. \r\n\r\n Note: Fatdog64 702 features the same kernel as 700 (3.18.7). This is a conscious decision to ensure that all existing 3rd party kernel modules for 700 will continue to work in 701. \r\n\r\n If you want a newer kernel, a 4.3.3 kernel is available \r\n\r\nmore info at:\r\n \nhttp://www.murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?t=102737\r\n\r\n\r\n.........\r\n\r\nnote that out of the box this distro is about the best bluetooth enabled distro out there. eg. send to and copy stuff from you bluethooth enabled phone with ease\r\n\r\naarf12\r\nas with most of my torrents this one is webseed so the absence of seeds on the pirate bay list is no problem if you have the right torrent client eg.
