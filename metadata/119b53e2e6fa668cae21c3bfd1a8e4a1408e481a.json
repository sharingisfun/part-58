We'll be covering all the steps needed to take a plain render and make it better. Weâ€™ll begin this project by creating a procedural dirt shader for our ground cover. Then we'll hop into Photoshop to create a photographic texture for our road. We'll then add some detail using more procedural textures to break up the edges of the road and create a broken concrete feel. From there we will set up a particle system for our tires and create render layers and passes. Finally we will composite our shot using the Maya Precomp feature and Maya Composite. We'll learn how to color correct our passes, add various blurs and composite everything together into an integrated shot","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:119b53e2e6fa668cae21c3bfd1a8e4a1408e481a","amp;dn":"DT-Finishing+a+Car+Animation+Render+and+Composite+in+MAYA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"119b53e2e6fa668cae21c3bfd1a8e4a1408e481a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,155,83,226,230,250,102,140,174,33,195,191,209,168,228,161,64,142,72,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
