Recorded in Sausalito as part of the Live at the Record Plant series, Mayhem Aforethought is Kinky Friedman &amp; the Texas Jewboys at their rawest. The gig was a finishing touch on the band's successful weeklong stand in the Bay Area with Commander Cody. Kinkymania was at its peak in 1973; the band had been playing sold-out shows in Texas and at Max's Kansas City in New York. The audience for the evening included Jerry Garcia and Ken Kesey. All the &quot;hits&quot; are here, from &quot;We Reserve the Right to Refuse Service to You,&quot; &quot;Get Your Biscuits in the Oven and Your Buns in the Bed,&quot; &quot;Sold American,&quot; and (of course) &quot;Ride 'Em Jewboy.&quot; The band, which included Billy Swan, is in fine form here, playing authentic Texas barroom honky tonk with lyrics guaranteed to offend everyone at the time; it's politically savvy and incorrect, sexist and rowdy, and alternately hilarious, smart, and obnoxious. As a historical document Mayhem Aforethought's worth is unquestionable, and it's more consistent than any of the band's studio recordings on Vanguard","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6055cde44a204ac1779caeec1b70b3056d172d8","amp;dn":"Kinky+Friedman+-+Mayhem+Aforethought+%28August+19%2C+1973%29+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6055cde44a204ac1779caeec1b70b3056d172d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,5,92,222,68,162,4,172,23,121,202,238,193,183,11,48,86,209,114,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
