He warned that a meltdown was imminent at Fukushima after the quake in Japan. In the first half, he covered recent news of ISIS targeting nuclear plants and the status of many distressed nuclear power plants in the US, and around the world. The latest concern is with Belgium's nuclear facilities. &quot;They have reason to worry,&quot; he said, &quot;because there's been drones launched over the French and Belgium nuclear plants, possibly doing surveillance...and no one knows who's been putting these up.&quot; We know that one of the Paris bombers was watching a chief nuclear officer for a facility in Belgium where they make radioactive isotopes, possibly for some kind of hostage or extortion scenario, he reported.\r\n\r\nFurther, there was a case of sabotage on a turbine at the Belgian Doel nuclear plant near Antwerp. What's worrisome about Russia, with their economy on the downturn, is that some of their scientists might sell nuclear material or secrets on the black market, he cautioned. Regarding Fukushima, it's been five years since the Nuclear Regulatory Commission learned lessons from that disaster, and still new safety measures haven't been incorporated into US' plants, Portzline lamented","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e79ceba09d9064aabc4067539e1bfafe3a4f1d00","amp;dn":"Nuclear+Sabotage+Coast+to+Coast+April+7%2C2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e79ceba09d9064aabc4067539e1bfafe3a4f1d00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,156,235,160,157,144,100,170,188,64,103,83,158,27,250,254,58,79,29,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
