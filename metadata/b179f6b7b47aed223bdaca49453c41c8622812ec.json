The first episode examines why British governments first shunned the new Common Market then begged to join it. It explores the decisive part played by three British prime ministers - Winston Churchill, Harold Macmillan and Edward Heath. After being humiliated by the French president Charles de Gaulle when Britain first applied to join, Heath triumphantly took the UK into the Common Market ten years later. But the seeds of today's problems were already being sown.\r\n\r\nThe unfamiliar story - sometimes witty, sometimes poignant - emerges from a series of special interviews with Heath and two of his successors, Tony Blair and David Cameron, as well as other key British players - Roy Jenkins, Enoch Powell, Shirley Williams, Barbara Castle, Norman Tebbit, Nigel Farage and William Hague - plus the main civil servants and diplomats involved on both sides of the English Channel. Some of the interviews come from the 1996 BBC Two series The Poisoned Chalice, also produced by John Bridcut.\r\n\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFile size : 1 016 MiB\r\nDuration : 59mn 3s\r\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\r\nOverall bit rate : 2 405 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : 2 309 Kbps\r\nMaximum bit rate : 3 500 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nBit rate : 93.5 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nText\r\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b179f6b7b47aed223bdaca49453c41c8622812ec","amp;dn":"BBC+Europe+Them+or+Us+1of2+An+Island+Apart+720p+x264+HEVCguy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b179f6b7b47aed223bdaca49453c41c8622812ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,121,246,183,180,122,237,34,59,218,202,73,69,60,65,200,98,40,18,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
