Jobs Disappoint. @danhenninger, #WSJ Editorial. Jim @mctaguej, #Barronâ€™s.\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦Charles Koch is also one half of what the Left simply calls â€œthe Koch brothers,â€ a phrase that evokes in their heads a galactic right-wing conspiracy. The other brother is David Koch, who lives in #Manhattan and who Mr. Trump knows.\r\n\r\nIt would be a very good idea before the general election if Mr. Trump talked about politicsâ€”more specifically, the point and purpose of politicsâ€”with Charles Koch. Heâ€™d find that the reasons Mr. Koch said supporting Hillary was possible are more counterintuitive than he would expect. It doesnâ€™t have much of anything to do with her. It has a lot to do with challenges he will face in a general election.\r\n\r\nâ€œNow 80, Charles Koch has been around politics long enough to be called one of the wise heads of the conservative movement. Not the Republican movement, the conservative movement. Like Mr. Trump, Charles Koch is in fact an outsider, no matter how many progressive books say that he personally operates the #Republican Death Star.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat one hears in Mr. Kochâ€™s comments about #Hillary is disappointment at where the conservative project has ended up in 2016. And if Charles Koch is disappointed, you can multiply that across the entire national base of conservative contributorsâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/charles-kochs-warning-1462400425?tesla=y\r\n\r\n___________\r\n\r\n&quot;...#Nonfarm payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 160,000 in April, the weakest gain since September, the #LaborDepartment said Friday. The unemployment rate held steady at 5%, but the share of Americans participating in the labor force dipped after earlier signs of stabilization.\r\n\r\n&quot;#Employment gains have now averaged 192,000 a month so far this year, down from 2015â€™s average of 229,000 jobs added monthly. After declining steadily from a post-recession peak of 10% in late 2009, the jobless rate has plateaued since last fall at a historically low level.\r\n \nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-payroll-gains-slow-in-april-adding-160-000-jobs-1462537988\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4feb599d3776fe1af682b4026fcb6f8d22156bd5","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+may+6+Koch+backoffs+Trump.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4feb599d3776fe1af682b4026fcb6f8d22156bd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,235,89,157,55,118,254,26,246,130,180,2,111,203,111,141,34,21,107,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
