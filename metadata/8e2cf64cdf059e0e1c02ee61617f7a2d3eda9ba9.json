Poisoned Teacups. Gregory Copley, Defense &amp; Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\nJohn Batchelor april 22,2016\r\n\r\nAnalysis. From GIS/Defense &amp; Foreign Affairs, Buenos Aires. There is little doubt that Argentinaâ€™s new conservative Government, under Pres. Mauricio Macri, wanted a new era of cooperation in US-Argentinean relations â€” so do most US officials â€” but that was not necessarily the thrust behind US Pres. Barack Obamaâ€™s March 23-25, 2016, visit to Buenos Aires.\r\n\r\nThe release of a UN report, a few days after the Obama visit, suddenly pronounced that Argentinaâ€™s territorial waters had, under its reckoning, increased by 35 percent, to include the Falkland Islands, which are British. The timing of the release of the report from the UN Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) was hardly coincidental. Or, rather, the timing of the Obama visit. The report had been completed by March 11, 2016, and was released on March 28, 2016.\r\n\r\nSignificantly, the US has not ratified the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and therefore is not a member of the CLCS, but, as with the UNâ€™s International Criminal Court (ICC, to which the US is also not a signatory), Washington works to exert pressures on and through these UN bodies. The timing and nature of the CLCS â€œrulingâ€ on Argentinean territorial waters, then, came as no surprise to Pres. Obama, even before his Buenos Aires visit.\r\n\r\nThe CLCS ruling increases Argentinaâ€™s claimed continental shelf jurisdiction by 1.7-million sq. km from its current 4.8-million sq. km, and refers to the area from the 200 miles exclusive economic zone limit to the shelf slope, an additional 150 miles.\r\n\r\nPres. Obama has exhibited a lifelong antipathy to British colonialism and 2016 represented the last year of the Obama Presidency, and his ability to make â€œhistory on the groundâ€: hence his visits, particularly, to Cuba and Argentina. The degree to which the White House prompted and supported the CLCS decision regarding Argentina through US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Powers is still under investigation. The Argentine submission to the CLCS was lodged in 2009 (although work on it was begun by Pres. Carlos Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella in 1995), and has, not surprisingly, been monitored by the US Government.\r\n \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/29/falkland-islands-argentina-waters-rules-un-commission\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e2cf64cdf059e0e1c02ee61617f7a2d3eda9ba9","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+-+Return+of+the+Falklands+War.-Obama%27s+Folly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e2cf64cdf059e0e1c02ee61617f7a2d3eda9ba9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,44,246,76,223,5,158,14,28,2,238,97,97,127,122,45,62,218,155,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
