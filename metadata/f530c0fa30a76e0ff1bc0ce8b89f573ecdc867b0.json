Who had to change the lyrics to their biggest hit because the originals were too obscene? Who married their 13-year-old cousin? Who used lard to get their hair just right? And what happened on the day the music died?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGSpot Says:\r\nDVD VOB format\r\nMPEG-2Program Stream &lt;&lt; (1 vid, 1 aud)\r\nSys Bitrate 10080 kb/s VBR 8589 kbps I/L TFF\r\nPAL 4:3\r\n\r\nAC3 0xbd(0x80):48000Hz 384 kb/s tot.\r\nstereo (2/0)\r\n\r\nPlay It LOUD!\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f530c0fa30a76e0ff1bc0ce8b89f573ecdc867b0","amp;dn":"KingsOfRockAndRoll-BBCTVDocumentary-DVD5-PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f530c0fa30a76e0ff1bc0ce8b89f573ecdc867b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,48,192,250,48,167,110,15,241,188,12,232,184,159,87,62,205,200,103,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
