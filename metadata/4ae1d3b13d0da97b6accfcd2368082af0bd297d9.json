Initially believed\r\nto be caused by a bio-terrorist attack using an airborne neurotoxin, the behavior quickly\r\nspreads across the northeastern United States. Elliot Moore, a high school science teacher\r\nin Philadelphia, hears about the attacks and decides to go to Harrisburg by train with his\r\nwife, Alma. They are accompanied by his friend Julian and Julian's eight-year-old daughter\r\nJess. Julian's wife is stuck in Philadelphia but is expected to meet them in Harrisburg.\r\nThe train loses all radio contact en route and stops at a small town. They receive word\r\nthat Philadelphia has been attacked by the toxin and Julian's wife was not able to get on\r\nthe train to Harrisburg. Julian decides to go look for her, leaving his daughter with the\r\nMoores while he hitches a ride. However, the town has already been hit by the toxin.\r\nSuccumbing to it, the driver and Julian both commit suicide...\r\n\r\nBox Office\r\n\r\nBudget: $48,000,000 (estimated)\r\nOpening Weekend: $30,517,109 (USA) (15 June 2008)\r\nGross: $81,687,587 (USA) (8 January 2016)\r\nWorldwide: $163,403,799 (Worldwide) / $98,896,925 (non-USA)\r\nFilming Dates: 6 August 2007 - November 2007\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that all screenshot was captured at 1080p, resized to 720p\r\nand then compressed using PNG to improve the loading time.\r\n \nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/467c1da.png  \r\n \nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/03e4651.png\r\n \nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/1e63f3d.png\r\n \nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/459e294.png\r\n \nhttps://i.imgsafe.org/655cb24.png  \r\n \nhttps://i1.someimage.com/OTWzXKv.png\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0949731/\r\n\r\n:: General ::\r\n\r\nFormat: Matroska/MKV\r\nFile Size: 8.19 GiB\r\nOverall Bit Rate: 13.0 Mbps\r\nFormat profile:   \r\nDuration: 01:30:23\r\nSample: Yes\r\nSubtitles: English\r\nChapters: Yes\r\nEncoded By oneanight\r\n\r\n:: Video Info ::\r\n\r\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nWriting library: x264\r\nVideo bitrate: 11 MB\r\nResolution: 1920 X 1040 pixels\r\nAspect ratio(AR): 1.85:1\r\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\r\n\r\n:: Audio Info ::\r\n\r\nFormat profile: DTS / AC3\r\nAudio Bit rate 1: 1509 Kbps\r\nAudio Bit rate 2: 448 Kbps Kbps\r\nCompression mode: Lossy/Lossy\r\nBit rate mode Constant/Constant\r\nAudio Language: English\r\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz Bit depth 24 bits/48.0 KHz\r\nChannel positions: Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nChannels:1 &amp; 2 6 channels 5.1 Surround\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ae1d3b13d0da97b6accfcd2368082af0bd297d9","amp;dn":"The+Happening+-+%5B2008%5D+1080p+BDRip+x264+DTS+AC3+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ae1d3b13d0da97b6accfcd2368082af0bd297d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,225,211,177,61,13,169,123,106,204,252,210,54,128,130,175,11,210,151,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
