Black Earth casts new light on old darkness. It demonstrates once and for all that the destruction of the #Jews was premised on the destruction of states and the institutions of politics. I know of no other historical work on the #Holocaust that is so deeply alarmed by its repercussions for the human future. This is a haunted and haunting bookâ€”erudite, provocative, and unforgettable.&quot; â€”Leon Wieseltier\r\n\r\n&quot;In this unusual and innovative book, Timothy Snyder takes a fresh look at the intellectual origins of the Holocaust, placing #Hitler's #genocide firmly in the politics and diplomacy of 1930s Europe. Black Earth is required reading for anyone who cares about this difficult period of history.&quot; â€”Anne Applebaum\r\n\r\nâ€œTimothy Snyder's bold new approach to the Holocaust links Hitler's racial worldview to the destruction of states and the quest for land and food. This insight leads to thought-provoking and disturbing conclusions for today's world. Black Earth uses the recent past's terrible inhumanity to underline an urgent need to rethink our own future.&quot; â€”Ian Kershaw\r\n\r\n&quot;Part history, part political theory, Black Earth is a learned and challenging reinterpretation.&quot; â€”Henry Kissinger\r\n\r\n&quot;Black Earth is provocative, challenging, and an important addition to our understanding of the Holocaust. As he did in Bloodlands, Timothy Snyder makes us rethink those things we were sure we already knew.&quot; â€”Deborah Lipstadt\r\n\r\nâ€œTimothy Snyderâ€™s Black Earth is not only a powerful exposure of the horrors of the Holocaust but also a compelling dissection of the Holocaustâ€™s continuing threat.â€ â€”Zbigniew Brzezinski\r\n\r\nTimothy Snyder is the Housum Professor of History at Yale University and a member of the Committee on Conscience of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. He is the author of Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin, which received the literature award of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Hannah Arendt Prize, and the Leipzig Book Prize for European Understanding. Snyder is a frequent contributor to The New York Review of Books and the Times Literary Supplement and a former contributing editor at The New Republic. He is a permanent fellow of the Institute for Human Sciences, serves as the faculty advisor for the Fortunoff Archive for Holocaust Testimonies, and sits on the advisory council of the Yivo Institute for Jewish Research. He lives in New Haven, Connecticut.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c1d5539621b66af08d541d29904fd8ba48c49c14","amp;dn":"Black+Earth%3A+The+Holocaust+as+History+and+Warning+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c1d5539621b66af08d541d29904fd8ba48c49c14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,213,83,150,33,182,106,240,141,84,29,41,144,79,216,186,72,196,156,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
