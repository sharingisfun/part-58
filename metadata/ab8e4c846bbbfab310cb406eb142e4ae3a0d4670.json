This episode explores the artists that made the soundtrack to the peace and love generation. The culmination of this era was when half a million people descended on a field in the small hamlet of Woodstock. At that moment rock music seemed a beacon of hope for those who believed in the ideals of equality and freedom. But instead of inspiring a new generation of artists to lead the revolution through political songs the festival proved to be a watershed moment for rock music's reactionary era. The marketing men lined up ready to sign and keen to turn this music from protest into profit.\r\n Interviewees include John Densmore and Ray Manzarek of the Doors, Creedence Clearwater Revival's Doug Clifford, Marty Balin of Jefferson Airplane, Alice Cooper, Tom Petty, MC5's Wayne Kramer and Steppenwolf's John Kay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGSpot Says:8510\r\nDVD VOB format\r\nMPEG-2Program Stream &lt;&lt; (1 vid, 1 aud)\r\nSys Bitrate 10080 kb/s VBR 8510 kbps I/L TFF\r\nPAL 16:9\r\n\r\nAC3 0xbd(0x80):48000Hz 384 kb/s tot.\r\nstereo (2/0)\r\n\r\n\r\nPlay It LOUD!\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab8e4c846bbbfab310cb406eb142e4ae3a0d4670","amp;dn":"BornToBeWild-pt.1-RidersOnTheStorm-BBC-DVD5-PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab8e4c846bbbfab310cb406eb142e4ae3a0d4670","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,142,76,132,107,187,250,179,16,203,64,110,177,66,228,174,58,13,70,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
