The album was released on January 18, 1978, by Asylum Records. It includes the top 40 success &quot;Werewolves of London&quot;. The album brought Warren to commercial attention and remains the best-selling album of his career. A remastered and expanded edition was released in 2007.\r\n\r\nThe tracks &quot;Excitable Boy&quot; and &quot;Werewolves of London&quot; were considered macabrely humorous by some critics. The historical &quot;Veracruz&quot; dramatizes the United States occupation of Veracruz, and likewise &quot;Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner&quot; is a fictionalization of a mercenary in Africa. &quot;Lawyers, Guns and Money&quot; is a tongue-in-cheek tale of a young American man's adventures in Cold War era Latin America. In addition, there are two ballads about life and relationships (&quot;Accidentally Like a Martyr&quot; and &quot;Tenderness on the Block&quot;), as well as a dance tune (&quot;Nighttime in the Switching Yard&quot;).\r\n\r\nI (analogkid6103) have added a collection of pics of this unique artist to this\r\nrelease.\r\n\r\nRipped from FLAC\r\n\r\nFormat: mp3\r\n\r\nBitrate: 320ak\r\n\r\nNote: This is not the 2007 reissue\r\n\r\n\r\nTrack listing\r\n\r\nAll songs written by Warren Zevon except as noted.\r\n\r\nNo. \tTitle \tLength\r\n\r\n1. \t&quot;Johnny Strikes Up the Band&quot;   \t2:49\r\n2. \t&quot;Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner&quot; (David Lindell, Zevon) \t3:47\r\n3. \t&quot;Excitable Boy&quot; (LeRoy Marinell, Zevon) \t2:40\r\n4. \t&quot;Werewolves of London&quot; (Marinell, Waddy Wachtel, Zevon) \t3:27\r\n5. \t&quot;Accidentally Like a Martyr&quot;   \t3:37\r\n6. \t&quot;Nighttime in the Switching Yard&quot; (Jorge CalderÃ³n, Lindell, Wachtel, Zevon) \t4:15\r\n7. \t&quot;Veracruz&quot; (CalderÃ³n, Zevon) \t3:30\r\n8. \t&quot;Tenderness on the Block&quot; (Jackson Browne, Zevon) \t3:55\r\n9. \t&quot;Lawyers, Guns and Money&quot;   \t3:29\r\n\r\nPersonnel\r\n\r\n    Warren Zevon â€“ lead, harmony and backing vocals, piano, organ, synthesizer\r\n    Jorge CalderÃ³n â€“ harmony and backing vocals, Spanish vocals on &quot;Veracruz&quot;\r\n    Danny &quot;Kootch&quot; Kortchmar - guitar, percussion\r\n    Russ Kunkel â€“ drums\r\n\r\nAdditional personnel\r\n\r\n    Karla Bonoff â€“ harmony vocals on &quot;Accidentally Like a Martyr&quot;\r\n    Jackson Browne â€“ guitar, harmony and backing vocals\r\n    Luis Damian â€“ jarana on &quot;Veracruz&quot;\r\n    Kenny Edwards â€“ bass on &quot;Veracruz&quot;, &quot;Tenderness on the Block&quot; and &quot;Lawyers, Guns and Money&quot;\r\n    John McVie - bass on &quot;Werewolves of London&quot;\r\n    Mick Fleetwood â€“ drums on &quot;Werewolves of London&quot;\r\n    The Gentlemen Boys [The Gentlemen Boys consisted of: Jackson Browne, Jorge CalderÃ³n, Kenny Edwards, J.
