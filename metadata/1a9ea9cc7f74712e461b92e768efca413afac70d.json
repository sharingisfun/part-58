For example, in August 2015, waste water and tailings from the Gold Creek Mine flooded into Cement Creek and the Animas River in Colorado, USA, turning them bright yellow. The spill was caused by the attempted remediation of historical mine wastes (7).\r\n\r\nâ€œContemporary tailings dam spills often affect river basins that have a legacy of historical contamination. On 25 April 1998, the Aznalcollar spill released ~4 to 5 million m3 of liquid and tailings bearing arsenic, copper, lead, and zinc to the RÃ­o Guadiamar in southwestern Spain (1). The tailings from the spill were removed from the floodplain during several cleanup operations, but later research revealed older contaminated alluvium underneath. As the river channel readjusted following the 1998 spill, this historically contaminated sediment was eroded and carried downstream toward DoÃ±ana National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site (8).\r\n\r\nâ€œPerhaps the most infamous historical mine wastes are those in the RÃ­o Tinto Mining District in Andalusia, Spain. Here, more than 5000 years of mining and natural weathering of the sulfide ores have created a strongly acidic (pH &lt; 3) 90-km-long river that bears arsenic, iron, copper, cadmium, nickel, lead, and zinc. Huge piles of waste rock have built up at its headwaters, and redand yellow-colored alluvium is found along its banks. Gross metal fluxes from historical wastes of the RÃ­o Tinto Mining District have a substantial impact on global and local element fluxes: According to calculations by Braungardt et al., 8.1% of the dissolved zinc flux and 1.6% of the dissolved copper flux in global rivers come from the RÃ­o Tinto (9). Resuspended mine waste dust from the RÃ­o Tinto area supplies 32% of the antimony, arsenic, bismuth, cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc to the local atmosphere (4), although the mean composition of these elements is below the daily EU limit value of 50 Âµg mâˆ’3â€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6283/288.full\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\t \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Gold_King_Mine_waste_water_spill \nhttp://johnbatchelorshow.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a9ea9cc7f74712e461b92e768efca413afac70d","amp;dn":"Animas+River+Spill+Irresponsible+EPA+John+Batchelor.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a9ea9cc7f74712e461b92e768efca413afac70d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,158,169,204,127,116,113,46,70,27,146,231,104,239,202,65,58,250,199,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
