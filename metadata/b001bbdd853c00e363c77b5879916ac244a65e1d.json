Everything, from the sort of life you lived to the relationships you had, is a complete blank.\r\nA young boy named Orion appears in front of you, revealing himself to be a spirit attached to your mind. Under Orion's guidance, you begin the struggle to regain your memories...\r\n\r\nBlunt âˆ™ Earnest &lt; Heart &gt;\r\nShin (VA: Tetsuya Kakihara)\r\nYour childhood friend and current boyfriend. He is only 18 years old, but has a very serious and cold demeanor that frequently causes conflicts with others his age. Oftentimes, he appears aloof and indifferent, but he is actually very affectionate and cares deeply for you. He is a senior in high school, and is currently preparing for university entrance exams. He is also Toma's childhood friend. \r\n\r\nAlluring âˆ™ Fascinating &lt; Spade &gt;\r\nIkki (VA: Kisho Taniyama)\r\nIkki has a unique condition that causes women to become enamored with him upon sight. He is 22 years old and is currently enrolled in a nearby university. Having given up on a genuine relationship, he lives the life of a playboy, indulging in the transient pleasures it brings. However, he becomes very close to you after he discovers his â€œeyesâ€ have no effect on your emotions toward him. Despite his looks and popularity, Ikki is really a kind and sincere man. He is a good friend of Kentâ€™s, a graduate student who attends the same university. \r\n\r\nCool âˆ™ Logical &lt; Clover &gt;\r\nKent (VA: Akira Ishida)\r\nA highly intelligent, 25-year-old mathematics graduate student, Kent sees the world from a purely objective point of view. He is normally very confident in his convictions and in the results of his relentless analysis of others; however, it seems as if he is unable to maintain the same composure when he is around you. His tendency to logically dissect every action makes him a difficult companion, especially among females. He is a good friend of Ikkiâ€™s, who competes with him in solving overly complex math puzzles. \r\n\r\nAffectionate âˆ™ Intense &lt; Diamond &gt;\r\nToma (VA: Satoshi Hino)\r\nToma is a 20-year-old law student at the university you both attend. Being your oldest friend from childhood, he has naturally assumed the role of your big brother. Toma has always kept an eye on you from a close distance, and takes on the responsibility of caring for you after you collapse on the road outside of your apartment. His desire to protect you is extremely strong, to the point that his mental state can become unpredictable... He is also a childhood friend of Shinâ€™s.\r\n\r\nMysterious âˆ™ Enigmatic &lt; Joker &gt;\r\nUkyo (VA: Kouki Miyata)\r\nA strange young man who appears unexpectedly. He gives you mysterious warnings, and disappears again without explanation. Whether he wants to protect you or harm you is unclear.\r\nFriend âˆ™ Protector\r\nOrion (VA: Yumi Igarashi)\r\nA spirit from a distant world. His outward appearance looks to the human eye as a 10-year-old boy. On his way to run a short errand in the human world, he crashes into you and becomes trapped inside your mind. He supports you in order to fulfill your mutual goal of regaining your memories.\r\n\r\nâ–  How to Play \r\nAfter the opening movie, the title screen will be shown.
