But the commitment of the Indian people to preserve their wildlife is surprising â€“ leading even to bringing back what has been lost. Against a backdrop of teak forest, farmland and villages, this film explores the extraordinary story of Asiaâ€™s last lions and their recovery from near extinction. From a mere 20 individuals a century ago, they now number over 400. But the lions have outgrown their sanctuary and spilled out into the surrounding countryside and villages. Yet here a unique relationship has developed between lions and people, revealing a story not of continual conflict as we might expect, but one of survival and tolerance.\r\n\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFile size : 481 MiB\r\nDuration : 53mn 10s\r\nOverall bit rate : 1 264 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat : HEVC\r\nBit rate : 1 102 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 29.970 (30000/1001) fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 10 bits\r\nBits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.040\r\nStream size : 419 MiB (87%)\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nBit rate : 160 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nText\r\nLanguage : English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7ba7b58ad2f96018a9ae7c2fd2d8a45cd1dc48a","amp;dn":"PBS+Nature+Indias+Wandering+Lions+720p+x265+HEVCguy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7ba7b58ad2f96018a9ae7c2fd2d8a45cd1dc48a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,186,123,88,173,47,150,1,138,154,231,194,253,45,138,69,205,29,196,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
