Control both at the same time using the same set of controls - when one moves left so does the other - and watch out for hazards colour matching the little tykes. \r\n\r\n -Key features:\r\n   Concentrate your way through 101 levels of fiendish puzzle-solving, death-defying and controller-throwing.\r\n    Choose your own route through the game's non-linear map. Have you got stuck? No worries! Just go and play a different level.\r\n    Love an extra-hard challenge? Replay levels against the clock to get the fastest time you can. Are you quick enough to get S rank on every level? (I'm not.)\r\n    A really funky adaptive music score that gets excited when you do well and chills out if youâ€™re stuck, to help you concentrate.\r\n    Laugh along with up to ten jokes! Look, I'm going to keep saying that it's funny. You'll come around eventually","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70b362df1e928e3a96b7d5ada60029950f9d63ff","amp;dn":"Binaries","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70b362df1e928e3a96b7d5ada60029950f9d63ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,179,98,223,30,146,142,58,150,183,213,173,166,0,41,149,15,157,99,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
