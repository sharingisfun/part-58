So if you want any of my torrents, you need to download them while the getting is good, because no one seeds my torrents, and I will stop seeding after initial seeding is complete. It would be nice if at least some of you did seed though.\r\n\r\ncOOt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e47ce3f043f9955c558010dd83e223572cb4a265","amp;dn":"Bronco+-+Season+2+%5BDVDRip%5D%5BXviD%5D+-+cOOt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e47ce3f043f9955c558010dd83e223572cb4a265","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,124,227,240,67,249,149,92,85,128,16,221,131,226,35,87,44,180,162,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
