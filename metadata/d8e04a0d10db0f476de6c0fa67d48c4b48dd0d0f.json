Humanity is nearing extinction and radiation is making even the most basic surface dwelling, uninhabitable. New life forms have arisen that are far better adapted to this new dark, damp and alien-like world. Bands of survivors live on without ever knowing the warmth of sunlight, and whether or not they are the last ones left on Earth. The Moscow Metro is the reluctant home for this new humanity and one you protect at all costs.\r\nMetro Stations have become city-states run by new and emerging Factions, uniting its members around ideas, religions, water, or simply the need to survive. Your daily existence centers around gathering resources necessary for survival, repelling attacks of mutants, exploring and conquering new metro stations and developing armed mercenary units when the need arises. To survive, you'll have to build necessary facilities at Stations, establish diplomatic relations with your neighbors and uphold the economy of your little underground state.\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES:\r\n- Classic Turn-based, highly strategic battles, with a wide variety of tactics and special attacks\r\n- Open World game play, with detailed, story-driven goals to guide you\r\n- 189 metro stations that you can trade, battle or inhabit, if you wish\r\n- 25 types of mercenaries with individual combat abilities to construct battle-ready Squads with\r\n- 24 different Factions to either battle or establish diplomatic relations with\r\n- 20 different building options to manage your resources and keep your clan alive\r\nGrim story, ambient soundtrack and the constant struggle for survival, will plunge you into the mysterious, post-apocalyptic atmosphere of â€œMetro 2033.â€\r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nAdditional information at: \r\nWWW.TAPSTARGAMES.COM\r\nTwitter: @TapstarGames\r\nFb: Tapstar\r\nGamesInstagram: TapstarGames\r\n  \r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s new:\r\n- Improved game balancing\r\n- Removed Reward Video (based on player feedback)\r\n- Fixed many bugs and crashes\r\n- Improved English text\r\n\r\nRequirements: Android OS 4.1+\r\nInstall APK,Place data folder in SDCard/Android/Obb/ and play","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8e04a0d10db0f476de6c0fa67d48c4b48dd0d0f","amp;dn":"Metro+2033+Wars+Born+In+The+Dark+v1.1.0+full","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8e04a0d10db0f476de6c0fa67d48c4b48dd0d0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,224,74,13,16,219,15,71,109,230,192,250,103,212,140,75,72,221,13,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
