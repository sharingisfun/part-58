This annual research conference showcases the people, companies, and key thought leaders working with the endocannabinoid system and medical concepts for the use of cannabinoid therapeutics in neurological disorders.\r\n\r\nWith over 27 US states and several countries now legalizing medicinal use of cannabis, the endocannabinoid system is becoming an important public health topic and a rich area of discovery for novel therapeutic interventions. With the recent advent of next generation sequencing and the enablement of personalized medicine, never before in history have we been as well-positioned to better understand the genetics and regulation of the endocannabinoid system. Likewise, the intersection of mobile analytical technologies is enabling a new field of safety testing for production of cannabinoids.\r\n\r\nRAPHAEL MECHOULAM\r\n\r\nJOHN GAITANIS\r\nDIRECTOR OF CHILD NEUROLOGY AT TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER/FLOATING HOSPITAL FOR CHILDREN\r\n\r\nRICHARD BOLES\r\nMEDICAL DIRECTOR\r\n\r\nCATHERINE JACOBSON\r\nDIRECTOR OF CLINICAL RESEARCH, TILRAY\r\n\r\nHUGH HEMPEL\r\nSTRAINZ, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO\r\n\r\nRYAN C.
