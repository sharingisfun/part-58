Landis (Wiley, 2012).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-118-11996-9\r\n\r\nThis book explores chemical bonds, their intrinsic energies, and the corresponding dissociation energies which are relevant in reactivity problems. It offers the first book on conceptual quantum chemistry, a key area for understanding chemical principles and predicting chemical properties. It presents NBO mathematical algorithms embedded in a well-tested and widely used computer program (currently, NBO 5.9). While encouraging a &quot;look under the hood&quot; (Appendix A), this book mainly enables students to gain proficiency in using the NBO program to re-express complex wavefunctions in terms of intuitive chemical concepts and orbital imagery","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66c199f2781c15d68c9c1322c1aae192ac56672d","amp;dn":"Discovering+Chemistry+With+Natural+Bond+Orbitals","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66c199f2781c15d68c9c1322c1aae192ac56672d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,193,153,242,120,28,21,214,140,156,19,34,193,170,225,146,172,86,103,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
