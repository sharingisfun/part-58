Balrum features a living fantasy world with deep tactical combat and dozens of side quests next to an epic main quest. In addition to traditional RPG features Balrum has deep crafting which allows the player to craft their own custom items. Balrum also features farming your own crops, building your home, and survival mechanics complemented by the game's main features. In Balrum you control a single character, but your character will have a faithful animal companion as a pet. Your pet is fully controllable and adds greatly to the complexity of the combat. \r\n\r\nFixes: \r\n-When the double mana usage debuff was active on the player the mana bar could display negative mana values. \r\n-The dungeon minimap now properly shows the player and pet tooltip. \r\n-Blind(melee) now requires a weapon. \r\n-A few typos. \r\n\r\nFor translators.
