Jeannie is just such a film, for Jeannie - and where has it been kept since it was made in 1941 - is as enchanting a bit of rue and nonsense as we've succumbed to in many a month. Based on Aimee Stuart's London stage play about a hardy little Scots girl, Jeannie is pure comedy of character. And what refreshing comedy it is! Actually, it is nothing more pretentious than an inverted Cinderella story about a plain-faced, plain-spoken little maid who inherits the sum of Â£297, spends it all in a few bewitching weeks in Vienna, and after a dispiriting adventure with a fortune-seeking count, discovers that the commonplace is more rewarding in the long run. With its plethora of good cheer, the film was able to garner good reviews on both sides of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 576x448, 25.000 fps, 1162 Kbps, 01h36m25s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, mono, 128 kbps\r\n\r\nTVRip, faint corner logo, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/sj9ymco03/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/vlh0676zx/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/kppmaum25/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/vo0vt1anh/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/n4hhva2b1/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:591bb02d8aa0e48a40c85966ba9964e87ea7a438","amp;dn":"Jeannie+%281941+-+UK%29+delightful+Scottish+lass+comedy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"591bb02d8aa0e48a40c85966ba9964e87ea7a438","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,27,176,45,138,160,228,138,64,200,89,102,186,153,100,232,126,167,164,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
