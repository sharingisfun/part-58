Desmond Lachman, AEI.\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦At the Pentagon two weeks ago, the day before a meeting of Mr. Obamaâ€™s national security team to discuss Chinese expansion in the Pacific, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was talking with Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., the commander of the United States Pacific Command, in the reception area of Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carterâ€™s office.\r\n\r\nâ€œWould you go to war over Scarborough Shoals?â€ General Dunford asked Admiral Harris, in a conversation overheard by a reporter. If Admiral Harris responded, it could not be heard.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe White House and the Pentagon have made it clear that they do not want a war with China over a group of uninhabited islands.\r\n \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/world/asia/south-china-sea-us-navy.html?_r=0\r\n \nhttp://time.com/4274666/arduous-march-north-korea-famine/\r\n \nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/12206185/North-Koreans-told-to-prepare-for-new-arduous-march.html\r\n \nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/if-trump-launched-a-trade-war-on-asia-1459270919","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbb1b01976194e9eb3695b79609c335472925bb2","amp;dn":"war-scarborough-shoals-famine-un-north-korea-trade-war-china.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbb1b01976194e9eb3695b79609c335472925bb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,177,176,25,118,25,78,158,179,105,91,121,96,156,51,84,114,146,91,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
