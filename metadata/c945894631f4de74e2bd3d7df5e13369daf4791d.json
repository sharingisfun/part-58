Since its initial development in the 1960s, HACCP has been increasingly used at every stage of the food chain. In many countries, it is a legal requirement for all food business operators to have some form of hazard analysis based on this system, and so there has been a growing interest in all aspects of HACCP.. Leatherhead Food Research has, for many years now, offered a comprehensive food safety training programme. These training courses are now going to be complemented with the first in a series of food safety publications. This guide is designed as an easy-to-use reference book to help all staff implement a thorough HACCP plan into their industry. A good understanding of HACCP is essential right across the board, from team leaders, production and engineering staff, and supervisors to those working the line including CCP monitors. The book contains detailed descriptions of all the basic information required to undertake a HACCP study. In addition to this, the book has been designed to allow photocopying of certain figures, tables and workflow diagrams. This publication has been designed as a practical user-friendly guide to HACCP, and is intended to be used as a reference back in the factory. It can be used as an introduction to the basics for those who have never received HACCP training or as a checklist for those who are already using HACCP on a daily basis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c945894631f4de74e2bd3d7df5e13369daf4791d","amp;dn":"HACCP+-+A+Toolkit+for+Implementation+2nd+ed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c945894631f4de74e2bd3d7df5e13369daf4791d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,69,137,70,49,244,222,116,226,189,61,125,245,225,51,105,218,244,121,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
