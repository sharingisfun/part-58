Above all, his defiance of political correctness makes this well- written, finely argued work of immediate practical value. The author has presented us with an inspiring defense not merely of intellectual integrityâ€”so lacking among todayâ€™s intelligentsiaâ€”but of our civilization.â€ â€”#RALPHPETERS, Fox News strategic analyst and author of Valley of the Shadow\r\n \nhttp://www.danielpipes.org/16647/figuring-out-radical-islam\r\n\r\nâ€œDr. Sebastian #Gorka is one of the worldâ€™s leading experts in asymmetric warfare. In Defeating Jihad you get a glimpse of why his opinion matters in councils of war and in academia. He combines the perceptive with the analytic, the piercing intellect with the grit of real-world experience.â€ â€”STEPHEN K. BANNON, executive chairman of Breitbart News\r\n \nhttp://allenwestrepublic.com/ \nhttp://www.danielpipes.org/\r\n\r\nâ€œAmerica is at war, an unconventional war against a new totalitarian enemy. Sebastian Gorka understands this kind of war and the mind of our new enemy. This book provides America with a strategy to destroy ISIS or any group that follows the ideology of global jihad.â€ â€”LT. GEN. CHARLES T. CLEVELAND, U.S. Army (Ret.), former Commanding General of U.S. Army Special Operations Command, home of the Green Berets\r\n \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_West_(politician) \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Pipes\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€œFor years Dr. Gorka has been telling the truth about the existential danger of #jihadism. The threat is real and it is here in America. With ISIS even more danger- ous than Al Qaeda, it is time to listen to what this man has to say. Defeating Jihad must be the foundation of our next commander in chiefâ€™s plan to win this war.â€â€”CONGRESSMAN TRENT FRANKS (R-Ariz.), member of the House Armed Services Committee\r\n\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease SEED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59d5543e39f82a2d28165092ad7484c4e045537a","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor+Defeating+Jihad%3A+The+Winnable+War+May+4%2C+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59d5543e39f82a2d28165092ad7484c4e045537a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,213,84,62,57,248,42,45,40,22,80,146,173,116,132,196,224,69,83,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
