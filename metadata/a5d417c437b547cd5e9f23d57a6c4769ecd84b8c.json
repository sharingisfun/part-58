The Class 156s were all built as two-car sets, each set comprising a pair of driving motor units. Powered by 6-cylinder diesel engines, Super Sprinters are rated to run at 75mph and are used mainly for suburban and short-haul branch line duties. All units have now passed from British Rail ownership into private hands, and are currently in operation with a number of train operators including Scotrail, Northern Rail, East Midlands Trains, and National Express East Anglia. \r\n\r\n**Please note that the Class 156 cannot be controlled using the in-game HUD driver interface or Xbox controller.\r\nUpdated Features\r\nProjecting exterior headlights for low light visibility \r\nCab night lighting (activated using Shift + L) \r\nQuickDrive Compatible\r\nKey Features:\r\nAdvance Warning System (AWS) self-test routine. \r\nFully functional destination blind (operates during game-play). \r\nWestinghouse notched brake system. \r\nAnimated cab accessories such as windows, sun blinds and arm rest. \r\nFully functional wheel slip protection (WSP) with realistic speedo fluctuations. \r\nHigh quality audio with stereo cab sound effects. \r\nSemi-functional â€œcompressor speed upâ€ feature. \r\nRealistic cab night lighting effects. \r\nDriver to guard buzzer. \r\nDrivers Reminder Application (DRA). \r\n6 liveries:Regional Railways, Express, CT, ONE, Northern and Scotrail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS ADDON WILL WORK ON LEGIT AND PIRATED VERSION OF TRAIN SIMULATOR 2016!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5d417c437b547cd5e9f23d57a6c4769ecd84b8c","amp;dn":"Railworks+TS2016+Oovee+Class+156+Loco+Add-On","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5d417c437b547cd5e9f23d57a6c4769ecd84b8c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,212,23,196,55,181,71,205,94,159,35,213,122,108,71,105,236,216,75,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
