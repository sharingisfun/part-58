The most obvious way is with his unwillingness to put up the money, though many overlooked his hesitance because he was doing so well with free media coverage.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe money was significant of something larger: his unwillingness to work out the whole path to the presidency, and his lack of 100% commitment to do the things necessary to succeed. Control his mouth. Recruit credible advisers. Produce a thoughtful policy program. Though it received surprisingly little commentary, his insistence on using his primary-victory rallies to flog his golf courses, product lines and related business interests.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere were signs to be read. The smarter half of his already-committed voters were looking, after Michigan, for him to show he could expand his coalition and fill out the image of a president. He didnâ€™t.\r\n\r\nâ€œAthletes, in postgame victory interviews, frequently say, â€œOur guys wanted it more.â€ The guy whose preferred epithet is â€œloser,â€ who defines himself as lifeâ€™s ultimate winner, failed this test. Itâ€™s hard to know exactly why. Maybe winning is only winning if he does it his way, refusing to meet expectations, including the mediaâ€™s demand that he fill out an acceptable picture of a president-in-waitingâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-we-knew-ye-1459900017","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d804c1357078c426e4e4ae040e9e14cde610721","amp;dn":"johnbatchelor-can-cruz-win-ca.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d804c1357078c426e4e4ae040e9e14cde610721","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,128,76,19,87,7,140,66,110,78,74,224,64,233,225,76,222,97,7,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
