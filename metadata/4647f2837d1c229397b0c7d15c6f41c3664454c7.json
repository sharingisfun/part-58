She transformed from a Jewish girl longing for family to one of the closest friends of Jesus of Nazareth -- the Son of God.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nHER NAME WAS MARY MAGDALENE.\r\n\r\nIn this fictionalized story of one of the Bible's most compelling women, New York Times best-selling author Joan Wolf beautifully recreates the history, romance, and tradition of Mary's world. Daughter of Jerusalem follows Mary's life from her first love through her loveless marriage, to the moment she heard of a miracle worker in her own town -- and ultimately to the moment she saw Him risen from the dead.\r\n\r\nAs this inspiring chronicle reminds us, Mary was the first to witness history's greatest moment. She was a woman who sought forgiveness for her sins, and a follower of God who yearned for a deeper faith. She was Jesus' beloved disciple. Read Mary Magdalene's story and find yourself in this remarkable woman's journey to discover the Kingdom of God","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4647f2837d1c229397b0c7d15c6f41c3664454c7","amp;dn":"Daughter+of+Jerusalem+-+Joan+Wolf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4647f2837d1c229397b0c7d15c6f41c3664454c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,71,242,131,125,28,34,147,151,176,199,209,92,111,65,195,102,68,84,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
