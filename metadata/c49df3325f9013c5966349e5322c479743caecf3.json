S. Lewis is the 20th century's most widely read Christian writer and J.R.R. Tolkien its most beloved mythmaker. For three decades, they and their closest associates formed a literary club known as the Inklings, which met every week in Lewis's Oxford rooms and in nearby pubs. They discussed literature, religion, and ideas; read aloud from works in progress; took philosophical rambles in woods and fields; gave one another companionship and criticism; and, in the process, rewrote the cultural history of modern times.â€\r\n \nhttp://us.macmillan.com/thefellowship/philipzaleski\r\n\r\nâ€œThe husband-and-wife team of Philip and Carol Zaleski bring to bear both extensive scholarship and a neatly interwoven narrative; this is a story about storytellers, and it shows . . . In The Fellowship, the authors never cease to feel for the Inklings, particularly sympathizing with their yearnings for spiritual and professional fulfillment, with occasional wry asides on the nature of their marriages and their politics to take note of shortcomings both personal and institutional. Taken together, it makes the overarching life of the group something greater than the sum of its parts.â€ â€•Genevieve Valentine, The New York Times Book Review","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c49df3325f9013c5966349e5322c479743caecf3","amp;dn":"johnbatchelor-fellowship-inklings-j-r-r-tolkien-c-s+lewis.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c49df3325f9013c5966349e5322c479743caecf3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,157,243,50,95,144,19,197,150,99,73,229,50,44,71,151,67,202,236,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
