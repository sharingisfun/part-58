Tyler Rogoway, Foxtrot Alpha.\r\n\r\njohn batchelor April 8,2016\r\n\r\nA few new details have also surfaced about the base. It is named â€œFirebase Bellâ€ and between 100 and 200 Marines are stationed there. These Marines were classified as â€œtemporarily deployedâ€ which has allowed them not to be added to the roughly 3,500 American troops that are authorized to be deployed to Iraq. This seems like a fairly rickety loophole that allows the White Houseâ€™s message of â€œno boots on the groundâ€ and a finite number of troops deployed in-country in non-combat roles to remain intact even though the truth may say otherwise.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe Pentagon says that the base is there for force protection only, being located in the vicinity of the town of Makhmour. As we mentioned in our previous piece on the previously undisclosed firebase, Makhmour is a major staging ground for Iraqi troops and US advisers as they prepare for the long awaited assault on Mosul. The military operations area in Makhmour is known as the Nineveh Operations Center, and will likely be a major command and control complex throughout the effort to take back Mosul from entrenched ISIS forces.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe idea that the fire-base exists just for defensive purposes is most likely not the entire story. Itâ€™s thought to lie somewhere northwest of Makhmour, putting it within around 40 miles of Mosul. Although standard artillery will not reach that far, the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systemâ€™s M31 GPS guided rockets can. In other words, with HiMARS the Marines could rain GPS guided rockets with 220lb warheads onto targets leading along the main route up to Mosul, all the way into the city itself, on demand and under any weather conditions.\r\n \nhttp://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/shadowy-marine-artillery-base-in-iraq-attacked-again-af-1766707053\r\n \nhttp://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/the-operation-to-retake-mosul-has-started-but-dont-exp-1766871837\r\n \nhttp://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/u-s-allies-borrowing-munitions-to-drop-on-isis-as-u-s-1767362416","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d3d404ad1563bda8a854c70e281ad43c12799ef","amp;dn":"john-batchelor-fire-base-bell-the-slow-road-to-mosul.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d3d404ad1563bda8a854c70e281ad43c12799ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,61,64,74,209,86,59,218,138,133,76,112,226,129,173,67,193,39,153,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
