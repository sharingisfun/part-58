Rather than an unwieldy dump of thousands of issues that are meticulously numbered and ordered (and whose filenames screw with modern comic reader parsers), the Chronology is presented as a series of ad-hoc collections with a simple volume ordering. I'll be releasing these in series of 10 volumes a piece.\r\n\r\nAs with previous releases of this chronology, strict chronology order has been followed as close as possible, though some flexibility and &quot;grain of salt&quot; needs to be used for proper interpretation. Books have been culled from a variety of sources and all credit goes to the original scanners/rippers\r\n\r\nNow included in all releases is a copy of the Overview and Roadmap, outlining major events and acting as a starter's guide to Superman's adventures to help new readers find jumping-on points","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc5758aabaa82f56e1de7dae1baa2a80217d4b57","amp;dn":"Superman+Post-Crisis+Chronology%2C+Volumes+131-140","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc5758aabaa82f56e1de7dae1baa2a80217d4b57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,87,88,170,186,168,47,86,225,222,125,174,27,170,42,128,33,125,75,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
