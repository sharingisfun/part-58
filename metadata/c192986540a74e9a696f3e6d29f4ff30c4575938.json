So if you want any of my torrents, you need to download them while the getting is good, because no one seeds my torrents, and I will stop seeding after initial seeding is complete. It would be nice if at least some of you did seed though.\r\n\r\ncOOt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c192986540a74e9a696f3e6d29f4ff30c4575938","amp;dn":"Bronco+-+Season+3+%5BDVDRip%5D%5BXviD%5D+-+cOOt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c192986540a74e9a696f3e6d29f4ff30c4575938","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,146,152,101,64,167,78,154,105,111,62,109,41,244,255,48,196,87,89,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
