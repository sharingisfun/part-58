In the '80s he formed the rather extraordinary jazz/fusion band that became Earthworks â€“ Bruford, saxophonist Iain Ballamy, keyboard and brass virtuoso Django Bates, and bassist Mick Hutton. This was their first album; an interesting one it was, though a later, live recording of the band presented some of the same material in a more highly developed state, rendering this original somewhat irrelevant.\r\n\r\nBruford is a stiff-wristed player â€“ not a particularly subtle percussionist, though his compositional skills are apparently of a high quality (most of the tunes are co-written with other band members, so it's hard to know how much credit to give Bruford). The best thing about this band is its refreshing ingenuousness; they make intelligent, sophisticated instrumental pop music that doesn't pander in the least. This is their art, and a fine art it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTracklist:\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n01 - Thud\r\n02 - Making A Song And Dance\r\n03 - Up North\r\n04 - Pressure\r\n05 - My Heart Declares A Holiday\r\n06 - Emotional Shirt\r\n07 - It Needn't End In Tears\r\n08 - The Shepherd Is Eternal\r\n09 - Bridge Of Inhibition\r\n\r\n*1990 Editions EG | EGCD 48\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel:\r\nBill Bruford - acoustic and electronic drums, percussion, whirled instruments\r\nDjango Bates - keyboards, tenor horn, trumpet\r\nIain Ballamy - soprano, alto and tenor saxophones\r\nMick Hutton - acoustic bass\r\n\r\nDave Stewart - co-producer (with Bruford), and credited with &quot;samples, keyboard bass, very occasional additional keyboards&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy and sharing, Thanks!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cb924198f16db11fbf18e53183b013fcb591eb3","amp;dn":"Bill+Bruford%27s+Earthworks+-+Earthworks+%281987%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cb924198f16db11fbf18e53183b013fcb591eb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,185,36,25,143,22,219,17,251,241,142,83,24,59,1,63,203,89,30,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
