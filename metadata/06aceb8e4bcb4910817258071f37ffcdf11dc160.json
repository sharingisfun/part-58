A boisterous comedy starring master comedians Joe Sears and Jaston Williams (helped by more than 40 lightning quick costume changes) who portray all 20 characters: men, women, children and animals. The show ushers us through a day in Tuna, starting with the morning broadcast from radio station OKKK and wandering in and out of the homes and Jaston Williams as Vera Carp &amp; businesses of the denizens of this colorful community. \r\n\r\nEver vigilant Vera Carp leads The Smut Snatchers of the New Order in their campaign to clear the library shelves of dirty books like &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; while the annual high school essay contest produces entries entitled &quot;Human Rights â€” Why Bother?&quot; and &quot;Living With Radiation.&quot; Elmer Watkins speaks up for the KKK and Petey Fisk argues for animal rights. UFO sightings, a celebrity murder and Didi's used weapons sale all contribute to the hilarity. GREATER TUNA is a funny, loving portrait of rural America... big hearts, small minds and all","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06aceb8e4bcb4910817258071f37ffcdf11dc160","amp;dn":"Greater+Tuna+%281994%29+DVD-RIP+720.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06aceb8e4bcb4910817258071f37ffcdf11dc160","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,172,235,142,75,203,73,16,129,114,88,7,31,55,255,205,241,29,193,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
