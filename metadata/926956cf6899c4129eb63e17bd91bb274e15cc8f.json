He goes to work for the Planet Express Corporation, a futuristic delivery service that transports packages to all five quadrants of the universe. His companions include the delivery ship's captain, Leela, a beautiful one-eyed female alien who kicks some serious butt, and Bender, a robot with very human flaws.\r\n\r\nWhichever way you would describe it, this torrent presents the entire 7 seasons in only 3.7gb, and that is the only true fact of the universe.
