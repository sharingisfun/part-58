Boris Volodarsky, London School of Economics\r\n\r\nThe Magnitsky Case &amp; the Kremlin Plan to Kill Bill Browder. Boris Volodarsky, London School of Economics.\r\n\r\nâ€œIâ€™m due to meet Bill Browder at Mari Vanna, a favourite hangout for rich Russians in Knightsbridge. But when we get there the restaurant, with its rustic dacha-style Russian decor, leaves us both feeling slightly spooked. So we wander across the road to an anonymous sushi bar. Browderâ€™s reluctance to avoid bumping into anyone with Kremlin connections is understandable. As he explains, matter-of-factly: â€œThey [the Kremlin] threatened to kill me. Itâ€™s pretty straightforward.â€\r\n\r\nâ€œAmerican-born Browder is one of Vladimir Putinâ€™s most prominent critics. For over a decade he lived in Moscow and ran the most successful investment fund in Russia. Initially, he was a fan of Putinâ€™s. But in 2005 he was deported from the country. A corrupt group of officials expropriated his fund, Hermitage Capital, and used it to make a fraudulent tax claim. They stole $230m (Â£153m).\r\n\r\nâ€œStuck in London, Browder hired a team to fight his case. The same Russian officials arrested his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, after Magnitsky uncovered the money trail and made a complaint. They put Magnitsky in jail and refused him medical treatment. (Magnitsky suffered from pancreatitis and gall stones.) After he had spent almost a year behind bars, guards beat him to death. He was 37 and married with two small boys.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe incident had a transforming effect on Browder. â€œIf Magnitsky had not been my lawyer he would still be alive,â€ he says. He describes Magnitskyâ€™s death as â€œabsolutely heartbreakingâ€. â€œIf he hadnâ€™t taken on my case heâ€™d still be enjoying his life, being a father, looking after his wife. A young man whom I was responsible for died in the most horrific way because he worked for me.â€â€¦\r\n \nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/25/-sp-bill-browder-kremlin-threatened-to-kill-me-vladimir-putin","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbbf7b7567593bfb2cefc6b6f13a0d57da1c8865","amp;dn":"John-Batchelor-magnitsky-case-kremlin-plan-kill-bill-browder.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbbf7b7567593bfb2cefc6b6f13a0d57da1c8865","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,191,123,117,103,89,59,251,44,239,198,182,241,58,13,87,218,28,136,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
