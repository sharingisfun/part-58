In the UK it aired during 1995 on Sky One and between 1995 and '96 on BBC Two. In the United States it was broadcast on Sci-Fi between 1994 and 1995. The series is a mix of science fiction and police procedural that combined elements of many of Anderson's previous series such as Space: 1999, UFO and Thunderbirds, but with an added dash of Law &amp; Order and Dragnet. Gerry Anderson and Tom Gutteridge were Executive Producers.\r\n\r\nThe special-effects-filled series was one of the highest-budgeted shows Anderson ever produced, and was relatively popular in Europe; however, in a repeat of the situation that UFO encountered 25 years earlier, American broadcasters were uncertain what to make of this series that looked on the surface to be aimed at children, yet actually featured adult-oriented storylines and was usually played straight despite the bizarre storylines and make-up. As a result, Space Precinct was often scheduled in late-night/early morning time slots. It failed to generate sufficient American ratings for a second season to be authorized. The idea for Space Precinct predated the series by nearly a decade. In 1986 Anderson produced Space Police, a pilot film that featured Anderson regular Shane Rimmer as Brogan. The series failed to sell at that time and the pilot was never aired.\r\n\r\nThe show is set in the year 2040, in Demeter City on the planet Altor and chronicles the adventures of two cops from Earth battling a rogue's gallery of alien criminals. Lieutenant Patrick Brogan (Ted Shackleford, Dallas)), a veteran New York cop, is transferred to Demeter City's Precinct 88. He and his wife and two kids have to adjust to life in this new world, which is populated by humans as well as two alien races, the Creons and the Tarns. Brogan is partnered with his old partner from his NY days, Officer Jack Haldane (Rob Youngblood, NYPD Blue, Sliders), and together they must adjust to living in another solar system and investigating crimes being committed by aliens as well as humans. Brogan and Haldane are supported by another human officer, Jane Castle (Simone Bendix) who has lived on Altor for a year, and is Haldane's love interest. \r\n\r\nAll other major characters, such as the Irishâ€“accented Creon, Captain Rexton Podly (Jerome Willis), were played by actors wearing complex make-up that also included elements of puppetry in order to depict the different alien races.\r\n\r\n\r\n** Note that the DVDs present the episodes in production order, not order of airdate.**\r\nDisc 1\r\nEpisode 1: &quot;Protect and Serve&quot; - March 18th, 1995\r\nEpisode 6: &quot;The Enforcer&quot; - April 22nd, 1995\r\nEpisode 4: &quot;Body &amp; Soul&quot; - April 8th, 1995\r\nEpisode 11: &quot;Double Duty&quot; - May 27th, 1995\r\nEpisode 2: &quot;The Snake&quot; - March 25th, 1995\r\n\r\nDisc 2\r\nEpisode 3: &quot;Time to Kill&quot; - April 1st, 1995\r\nEpisode 5: &quot;Deadline&quot; - April 15th, 1995\r\nEpisode 9: &quot;Seek and Destroy&quot; - May 13th, 1995\r\nEpisode 12: &quot;The Power&quot; - June 3rd, 1995\r\nEpisode 10: &quot;Illegal&quot; - May 20th, 1995\r\n\r\nDisc 3\r\nEpisode 22: &quot;Divided We Stand&quot; - August 12th, 1995\r\nEpisode 7: &quot;Two Against the Rock&quot; - April 29th, 1995\r\nEpisode 13: &quot;Takeover&quot; - June 10th, 1995\r\nEpisode 8: &quot;Predator and Prey&quot; - May 6th, 1995\r\nEpisode 15: &quot;The Witness&quot; - June 24th, 1995\r\n\r\nDisc 4\r\nEpisode 14: &quot;Hate Street&quot; - June 17th, 1995\r\nEpisode 17: &quot;Friends&quot; - July 8th, 1995\r\nEpisode 18: &quot;Smelter Skelter&quot; - July 15th, 1995\r\nEpisode 16: &quot;Flash&quot; - July 1st, 1995\r\n\r\nDisc 5\r\nEpisode 19: &quot;The Fire Within&quot; (Part 1) - July 22nd, 1995\r\nEpisode 20: &quot;The Fire Within&quot; (Part 2) - July 29th, 1995\r\nEpisode 21: &quot;The Forever Beetle&quot; - August 5th, 1995\r\nEpisode 23: &quot;Deathwatch&quot; (Part 1) - August 19th, 1995\r\nEpisode 24: &quot;Deathwatch&quot; (Part 2) - August 26th, 1995 \r\n\r\nAudio:English\r\nSubtitles:None\r\nSpecial features:None","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc765d88d304f2ebd9630b528b5c577c19eb59e1","amp;dn":"Space+Precinct+The+complete+DVD+collection","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc765d88d304f2ebd9630b528b5c577c19eb59e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,118,93,136,211,4,242,235,217,99,11,82,139,92,87,124,25,235,89,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
