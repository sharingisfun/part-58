Mostafa Ghiaasiaan (CUP, 2011).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-107-00350-7\r\n\r\nThis book was developed during Professor Ghiaasiaan's twelve years of teaching a graduate-level course on convection heat and mass transfer. It is ideal for a graduate course covering the theory and practice of convection heat and mass transfer. The book treats well-established theory and practice but is also enriched by its coverage of modern areas such as flow in microchannels, computational fluid dynamics-based design and analysis methods. Primarily concerned with convection heat transfer, with the essentials of mass transfer also covered. The mass transfer material and problems are presented in such a way that they can be skipped if not required. The book is richly enhanced by examples and end-of-chapter exercises. A complete solutions manual is available to qualified instructors. The book includes eighteen appendices providing compilations of most essential property and mathematical information for analysis of convective heat and mass transfer processes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dda6c2ac4453b03187616c9be4799479a6bd0006","amp;dn":"Convective+Heat+and+Mass+Transfer+-+S.+Mostafa+Ghiaasiaan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dda6c2ac4453b03187616c9be4799479a6bd0006","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,166,194,172,68,83,176,49,135,97,108,155,228,121,148,121,166,189,0,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
