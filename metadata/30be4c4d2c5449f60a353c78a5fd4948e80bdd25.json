After a distinguished career in cosmology Professor Martin Rees, the astronomer royal, has taken up the search for extra-terrestrials. Looking for aliens is no longer science fiction - it is a question that's engaging some of the greatest minds in science.\r\n\r\nAs our knowledge of the universe has increased, we're getting closer to answers. Many scientists now think we live in galaxy with a billion Earth-like planets, many of which may be teeming with life. But what kind of life? Has anything evolved into beings we could communicate with? This film gets inside the minds of the scientists considering one of the most exciting and profound questions we can ask - are we alone in the universe?\r\n\r\nProfessor Rees thinks we may have our idea of what an alien is like all wrong. If he's right, it's not organic extra-terrestrials we should look for, it's machines.\r\n\r\nFormat : Matroska\r\nFile size : 1 003 MiB\r\nDuration : 58mn 56s\r\nOverall bit rate mode : Variable\r\nOverall bit rate : 2 380 Kbps\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nFormat : AVC\r\nBit rate mode : Variable\r\nBit rate : 2 284 Kbps\r\nMaximum bit rate : 3 500 Kbps\r\nWidth : 1 280 pixels\r\nHeight : 720 pixels\r\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\r\nFrame rate mode : Constant\r\nFrame rate : 25.000 fps\r\nColor space : YUV\r\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\r\nBit depth : 8 bits\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat : AAC\r\nBit rate : 93.5 Kbps\r\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\r\nChannel positions : Front: L R\r\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nText\r\nLanguage : English\r\n \nhttps://yuq.me/users/52/888/ZrW1bA7SyD.jpg \nhttps://yuq.me/users/52/888/NASG4giDTn.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30be4c4d2c5449f60a353c78a5fd4948e80bdd25","amp;dn":"BBC+Aliens+The+Big+Think+720p+x264+HEVCguy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30be4c4d2c5449f60a353c78a5fd4948e80bdd25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,190,76,77,44,84,73,246,10,53,60,120,165,253,73,72,232,11,221,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
