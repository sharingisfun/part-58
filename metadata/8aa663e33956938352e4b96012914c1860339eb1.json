Significant advantages are observed in aspects such as:\r\nâ€¢\tAppreciable reduction in installation time, which takes 15 minutes with a DVD disk or USB flash drive. Time savings also occurred when reformatting a PC with a clean installation of MicrosoftÂ® WindowsÂ®, along with the additional programs; requiring less than 2 minutes and 15 clicks to complete the installation;\r\nâ€¢\tSignificant increase in processing speed;\r\nâ€¢\tEnhanced security;\r\nâ€¢\tGreater stability with fewer crashes and/or system reboots;\r\nâ€¢\tImproved performance even when installed on older computers;\r\nâ€¢\tUser interface, whose menus, icons, shortcuts, toolbar, taskbar and default configuration are reorganized, thus making computers much more interactive and user friendly;\r\nâ€¢\tSimplified, more intuitive operating system resources reduce time learning for users.\r\n\r\nRafael Jacob Galapo Rosenthal is a Human/Computer Interaction (HCI) developer","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aa663e33956938352e4b96012914c1860339eb1","amp;dn":"RafaWay+for+Windows+10+1511+10586+x64+Pro+Legacy+P+RW10PLENPTG01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aa663e33956938352e4b96012914c1860339eb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,166,99,227,57,86,147,131,82,228,185,96,18,145,76,24,96,51,158,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
