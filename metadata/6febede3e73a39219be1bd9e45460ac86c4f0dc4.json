Gregory Copley, Defense &amp; Foreign Affairs\r\n\r\n...Humanityâ€™s present mini-age is close to its end. Everything changes when an age ends, because new values, weights, and priorities emerge. And all ages end. What we have recently experienced can be described as â€œthe age of consumerism and scaleâ€.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat will emerge are changed forms of governance, society, and security. By definition, then, the global balance of power will change in ways which differ from the present architecture.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe impending decline in global population levels â€” particularly within the major industrial societies â€” highlights why this unique episode in human behavior and history is passing, pointing the way to new economic and social models, which will start to emerge within the coming decades.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe second half of the 20th Century was characterized by unprecedented scale married to several equally unprecedented, absolutely mutually-reinforcing and interdependent phenomena:\r\n\r\nâ€¢\t1. Compounding technological evolution (and therefore compounding efficiency in the output of goods, services, food, and energy), mostly linked to electricity. This led to the easy production of surpluses in almost all biological as well as inanimate products1;\r\n\r\nâ€¢\t2. Dramatically rising average per capita wealth, leading to improving caloric intake, longevity, and more successful live birth rates globally;\r\n\r\nâ€¢\t3. The consolidation, efficiency, and scale of an open global trading and supply chain architecture;\r\n\r\nâ€¢\t4. The urbanization of the majority of the worldâ€™s population; and\r\n\r\nâ€¢\t5. The temporary bubble of the trebling of the global human population2.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhat was created, post World War II, by the resultant wealth/population growth/ technology matrix was the evolution of a societal management model predicated (on the one hand) on growth in the scale of human numbers, and (on the other hand), the counterpoint of human population growth predicated upon wealth and technological support within an open-architecture economic model.\r\n\r\nâ€œIn other words, the rÃ´le of most members of the global population came to be that they should function primarily as a consumption base.\r\n\r\nâ€œGrowing human numbers enabled the scaling of production and the development of logistical capabilities to service that larger market.\r\n\r\nâ€œTo put it more succinctly: the principal function of most people in this brief era was to be consumers, and to earn the means of acquisition of their consumables to sustain this rÃ´le. In this fashion, they had only two main qualities: to provide markets for all manufactures; and to provide scale to the overall economy, thereby also maximizing the scale of surplus wealth generated. As a result of the scale and the urbanization, fewer and fewer people were existentially necessary for â€œvitalâ€ or meaningful work, and were relegated to â€œemployment for employmentâ€™s sakeâ€, in order to both sustain them and their families, and to serve as â€œconsumersâ€.\r\n\r\nâ€œThis was not necessarily a conscious division of society, but an inevitable outgrowth of the dramatic rise in productivity and the creation of food surpluses, and of population growth and, particularly, urbanization.\r\n\r\nâ€œThere was, as a result, an inevitable unplanned, rapid growth in income disparity, given the natural ratio of leaders-to-followers in any mammalian species. Fewer economic leaders (in proportional relation to total population) has led to a greater consolidation of production capacity and surpluses in the hands of a small percentage of people. On the other hand, relative wealth growth generally has enabled security and comfort on a scale and dispersal unprecedented in history, marred only by one of the fundamental motivational human factors: envyâ€¦.â€","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6febede3e73a39219be1bd9e45460ac86c4f0dc4","amp;dn":"John-Batchelor-retreat-wealth-post-global-age.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6febede3e73a39219be1bd9e45460ac86c4f0dc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,235,237,227,231,58,57,33,155,225,189,158,69,70,10,200,108,79,13,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
