Failed Galaxies by #KenCroswell, #ScientificAmerican.\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦History shows that vast economic gains are likely to accrue to any state that can improve the quality of its schools. But history also shows that state politics are affected both by myopia and by intense conflicts when it comes to schools. Moreover, policymakers may systematically underestimate the economic benefits of improved schools in their states.\r\n\r\nâ€œConsider first the economic impact of school improvement. We know that states differ dramatically in income: the #GDP per capita in #Delaware is twice that in #Mississippi. What the future will be depends on growth rates across the states, and historically these, too, have differed significantly. North Dakotaâ€™s growth over the past four decades of 3 percent per year is more than double the 1.2 percent of Nevada.\r\n\r\nâ€œResearch released last week by me, Jens Ruhose, and Ludger Woessmann shows that differences in state growth rates are directly related to the skills of the stateâ€™s workers. For the first time, we have been able to link the quality of a stateâ€™s schools to the stateâ€™s economic future. While other factors also enter, none has a long-run impact equal to improving school quality. And, none can be as readily affected by public policy as the quality of a stateâ€™s schoolsâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.realcleareducation.com/articles/2016/04/29/student_achievement_and_every_states_economic_future_1285.html\r\n\r\nThe John Batchelor Show\t\r\n \nhttp://johnbatchelorshow.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff22788c8c7ed33fe57a09b835c755d6ef7b9d55","amp;dn":"Student+Achievement++Economic+Futures+John+Batchelor.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff22788c8c7ed33fe57a09b835c755d6ef7b9d55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,34,120,140,140,126,211,63,229,122,9,184,53,199,85,214,239,123,157,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
