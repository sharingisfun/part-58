Starting as a weekly in the mid-1920s, the magazine is now published 47 times per year, with five of these issues covering two-week spans. Although its reviews and events listings often focus on cultural life of New York City, The New Yorker has a wide audience outside of New York and USA. It is well known in its commentaries on popular culture and eccentric Americana; its attention to modern fiction by the inclusion of short stories and literary reviews; its rigorous fact checking and copyediting; its journalism on world politics and social issues; and its famous, single-panel cartoons sprinkled throughout each issue.\r\n\r\nThe New Yorker â€“ 11 April 2016\r\nEnglish | 92 pages | PDF | 14.01 Mb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b786560e9d82d351ebd9a82cb0b86792010ae27","amp;dn":"The+New+Yorker+%26ndash%3B+11+April+2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b786560e9d82d351ebd9a82cb0b86792010ae27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,120,101,96,233,216,45,53,30,189,154,130,203,11,134,121,32,16,174,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
