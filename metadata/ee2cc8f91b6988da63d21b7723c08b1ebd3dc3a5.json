In any case, if you like crazy and implausible, 'X' marks the spot.\r\n\r\nDespite some of the pain it caused me, Agent X also provided, in the same package, a salve. The backstory: Five days before reviewing TNTâ€™s new spy/whatever drama, I tweaked my back and was barely walking around. By the fifth day, it was mostly better, thanks to loads of Advil. Then I watched the first hour of Agent X and laughed so hard I hurt myself again.\r\n\r\nBut I kept watching â€” and laughing â€” and realized Agent X could bring a lot of pleasure on a weekly basis as I create the inevitable Agent X Drinking Game. Anyway, the point is, youâ€™ve got to laugh to keep from crying.\r\n\r\nI should mention is that Agent X is not supposed to be a comedy. Itâ€™s a drama. TNT had a chance to get out in front of this thing and claim it as a spoof, but apparently that didnâ€™t occur to them. So unfortunately Agent X remains an intentional drama, one that is insanely but deliciously bad. Hilariously bad.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to explain the premise alone without laughing. Letâ€™s try: Agent X is about how newly elected vice president Sharon Stone (her show name is Natalie Maccabee but thatâ€™s only half as funny) finds out from an Alfred-like butler at the vice presidentâ€™s residence &quot;the greatest secret in the history of our country.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe secret is that the â€œrealâ€ Constitution (kept secret from everyone) â€“ follow along! â€“ contains a fifth section to article two, not just four sections like everybody thinks (meaning everybody who knows the Constitution, which in this country is basically nobody). Anyway, the secret fifth section states this (you might want to sit down): &quot;An agent of unknown identity is hereby authorized to serve at the discretion of the vice president for the purpose of aiding the Republic in times of dire peril.&quot;\r\n\r\nYep.\r\n\r\nAs the vice president, Stone reacts with a faux stunned look. As it should be. The vice president is now capable of sending out an American James Bond to do black ops work. Who the hell wouldnâ€™t be both stunned and excited? The camera cuts back to Stone again and, yes, she's still shocked. Or then again, she may have been thinking, &quot;Iâ€™ve made a huge mistake.&quot;\r\n\r\nHereâ€™s the thing you need to know about the Agent X Drinking Game I have in the works: Most of the drinking will be based on reaction shots, since Agent X has quadruple the amount of close-ups of faces reflecting surprise, disdain, disappointment and often just blankness â€” of any other drama on TV. Think Leslie Nielsen in Police Squad!\r\n\r\nStoneâ€™s presence on Agent X is odd. Yes, sheâ€™s an executive producer but that she, or any number of the actors on this show, agreed to be on this series is kind of baffling. They all deserve better material. She should have held out for something on HBO or Showtime, since her role here is basically to play second fiddle to the actual agent in the title, ruggedly handsome John Case (Jeff Hephner).\r\n\r\nIn the first two hours â€” which TNT will run together on Nov. 8 â€” Stoneâ€™s role is to compile as many patently unbelievable reaction shots as possible. Every now and then she gets an actual scene. Mostly they have her saying dumb stuff like, upon opening the secret Freemasons-like cave door of the Residence, &quot;Tell me this is a wine cellar.&quot; And then seeing the underground Batman-esque lair, she says very slowly, &quot;Shut...the...front...door.&quot; Later, watching from the lair as Agent Caseâ€™s button camera reveals all of his terrible fighting scenes, she says, &quot;Holy Toledo.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee2cc8f91b6988da63d21b7723c08b1ebd3dc3a5","amp;dn":"Agent+X+-+Season+1+-++Episodes+1+thru+10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee2cc8f91b6988da63d21b7723c08b1ebd3dc3a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,44,200,249,27,105,136,218,99,210,27,119,35,192,139,30,189,61,195,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
