CDG+MP3 format sorted by Artist and the letter T.   Pirate Bay users please view the torrent files for the track listing.   Thank you for seeding the last part.  It is not possible for any one person or seed box to host the entire collection all at once due to the number of open files that would produce.\r\n\r\nWhile a Film only takes 2 or 3 files for example this 2.6GB download has 800 files due to the way Karaoke is organised.   The whole collection runs to well over 100,000 files and no single PC, MAC or seed box can host them all without serious file and memory handling problems.\r\n\r\nRunning more than ONE DOWNLOAD at any time is silly.   Your upload speed to any downloading torrent is the key to fast download speeds.   To Dilute that upload speed over dozens of torrents is JUST PLAIN STUPID.\r\n\r\nQ.  When is a seed box NOT worth a damn?\r\n\r\nA.  When it is seeding more torrents than it has upload bandwidth to cope with the\r\n    demand from all the peers in ALL the seeding torrents.\r\n\r\nRigmar Radio - Educating the Bit Torrent user since 2003","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b97beb1bbe6ce1a90bf210015f282d9a84041b08","amp;dn":"Rigmar+Radio+Karaoke+Collection+51300","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b97beb1bbe6ce1a90bf210015f282d9a84041b08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,123,235,27,190,108,225,169,11,242,16,1,95,40,45,154,132,4,27,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
