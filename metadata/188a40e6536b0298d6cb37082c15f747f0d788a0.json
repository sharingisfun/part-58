His mods ask too many sensitive permissions, more than the original games. Such as personal info of your phone. Iâ€™m not a modder to remove such permissions and he denies that he abuses personal info. So far there are some complains that out of nowhere there are sms sent and cost services to receive more of such annoying commercials. So Iâ€™m warning you to play offline this game and any of his mods. I felt a bit forced to upload it since itâ€™s a request and Iâ€™m asking other modders if they can do it but until then youâ€™ll never see his mods on my torrents.\r\n\r\nRequirements: Android OS 4.0+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:188a40e6536b0298d6cb37082c15f747f0d788a0","amp;dn":"High+School+Story+v3.8.0+mega+mod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"188a40e6536b0298d6cb37082c15f747f0d788a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,138,64,230,83,107,2,152,214,203,55,8,44,21,247,71,240,215,136,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
