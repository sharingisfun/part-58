While fuzzy-headed liberals dreamed of building Utopia here on earth, conservatives recognized that sometimes there are no win-win solutions - sometimes you have to make the best of a bad lot. You can fight the South to preserve the Union - but it will result in hundreds of thousands of deaths. You can stop Hitler - but you will have to ally with Stalin to do so. You can preserve the free enterprise system - but you will have to compromise on some issues to prevent the rise of socialism.\r\n\r\n \nhttp://www.lauraingraham.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a27309fd03c3982da6d31e8cf9c4b2adbb603b6","amp;dn":"The-Laura-Ingraham-Show-Podcast+May+4%2C2016","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a27309fd03c3982da6d31e8cf9c4b2adbb603b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,39,48,159,208,60,57,130,218,109,49,232,207,156,75,42,219,182,3,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
