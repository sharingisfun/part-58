The problem is that it seems like everything is trying to break you! That is, with the exception of Chip: A friendly computer helper who is totally your friend! \r\n\r\nGameplay \r\n\r\nThe gameplay is as simple as it is satisfying. Blitz can only jump, and perform an air dash in one of 4 directions. Upon colliding with an object that doesn't break you, you are free to dash again. Use this to navigate a variety of challenges and hazards, including spikes, cannons, missiles, lasers, mines and even giant mechanical monsters. \r\n\r\nFeaturing challenging but fair difficulty, the skill lies in your timing, and ability to react. Perfecting these skills grants you stars, which are used to unlock additional heads to dress Blitz up in. Your ability to search and explore can lead you to secrets, and keys to portals harboring even greater challenges. \r\n\r\nFeatures \r\n\r\nSimple + multiple control schemes. You can play with keyboard or gamepad (optimized for 360 gamepad), and the entire game can be played one handed. (Currently working on support for Steam Controller) \r\nTough but fair difficulty \r\n101 lovingly handed crafted levels \r\nFour boss levels to challenge and conquer \r\nOver 20 heads to discover and collect (some are more secret than others) \r\nSecret Warp Zones to unlock and challenge \r\nA wicked chiptune sound track by Fat Bard \r\nFantastic arcade cabinet style side art to decorate your experience\r\n\r\nSCREENSHOTS\r\n\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/LoQuVo7.jpg[/img]\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/ltBb2XY.jpg[/img]\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/SSUcAwb.jpg[/img]\r\n[img]http://i.imgur.com/UmDFBqR.jpg[/img]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease leave feedback and say thanks so i keep sharing :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43116926374c6538bd42a7abde3d0d13a1ab6e03","amp;dn":"Blitz+Breaker+1.2.0.0+-+TheDarkKnight","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43116926374c6538bd42a7abde3d0d13a1ab6e03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,17,105,38,55,76,101,56,189,66,167,171,222,61,13,19,161,171,110,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
