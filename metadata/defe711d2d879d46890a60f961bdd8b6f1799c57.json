The high-resolution images have a size of around 2000 x 4000 pixel per person.\r\n\r\nThe clip-maps are directly provided as Artlantis Billboards â€“ and can directly be used in Artlantis, starting version 2. Now the product supports Artlantis 5. The billboards are directly provided as .atlo files.\r\n\r\nEach picture comes with the matching alpha-channel. As usual with Dosch Design products all Dosch Viz-Images are license-free, and can therefore be used in commercial pictures &amp; designs at no extra charge","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:defe711d2d879d46890a60f961bdd8b6f1799c57","amp;dn":"DOSCH+Viz-+Images+People+Urban","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"defe711d2d879d46890a60f961bdd8b6f1799c57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,254,113,29,45,135,157,70,137,10,96,249,97,189,216,182,241,121,156,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
