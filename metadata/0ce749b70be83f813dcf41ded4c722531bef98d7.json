Kennedy by Brian Latell. MP3\r\n\r\nJohn Batchelor April 9,2016\r\n\r\nâ€œBrilliant . . . This unique book not only traces Fidel Castro's extraordinary intelligence service and its acts against the U.S., but it also analyzes America's -- and especially the overeager Kennedy boys' -- attempts to kill Castro . . . informative (and wonderfully readable) . . . Latell's book, enhanced by the author's rich experience, radar-like understanding of the peculiar people involved and mastery of history, is an important contribution to understanding this crucial period that changed us much more than we imagine.â€ â€•Georgie Anne Geyer, The Columbus Dispatch\r\n\r\nâ€œCastro's Secrets begins like a slow murder mystery then builds damning fact after damning fact into a conclusive, ground-breaking portrait, based on firsthand sources, of how the Cuban strongman--in all his evil brilliance--frequently ran circles around the CIA . . . The most interesting parts of his narrative revolve around how much Castro knew about the plot to kill Kennedy, and a parallel attempt, on the part of the CIA, to assassinate the Cuban dictator . . . One of the successes of Castro's Secrets is that it offers readers a view of both sides of the shadow war.â€ â€•The Daily Beast\r\n\r\nâ€œA fascinating study of Castro's intelligence network and its early battles with the CIA to secure Castro's hold on power.â€ â€•The Sunday Times\r\n\r\nâ€œBritan Latell, for four decades the CIA's ranking authority on all matters Castro and Cuban, has ripped the shroud off the circumstances behind one of the more flagrant instances of journalistic malpractice ever in the Washington media.â€ â€•The Washington Times","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ce749b70be83f813dcf41ded4c722531bef98d7","amp;dn":"John-Batchelor-castros-secrets-assassination-JFK.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ce749b70be83f813dcf41ded4c722531bef98d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,231,73,183,11,232,63,129,61,207,65,222,212,199,34,83,27,239,152,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
