It starts by looking at the introduction of English into India's complex language scenario around 1800. It then takes up the canonical poets, novelists, and  ramatists, as well as a few unjustly forgotten figures, who have contributed significantly to the evolution of Indian literature in English.\r\nThe book comprises twenty-four chapters, written by some of India's foremost  cholars and critics. \r\nEach chapter is devoted either to a single author (Kipling, Tagore, Sri Aurobindo, R.K. Narayan), or to a group of authors (the Dutt family of nineteenth-century Calcutta; the Indian diasporic writers of the twentieth century), or to a genre (beginnings of the Indian novel; poetry since Independence).\r\nA unique feature of the book is the illustrations. They range from rare photographs and drawings to comic books and popular prints, and have been collected especially for this volume, making it the first illustrated history of any of the Indian literatures","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32e9297ff095ddb85014a5ff167db0d3e430ed80","amp;dn":"History+of+Indian+Literature+in+English+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32e9297ff095ddb85014a5ff167db0d3e430ed80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,233,41,127,240,149,221,184,80,20,165,255,22,125,176,211,228,48,237,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
