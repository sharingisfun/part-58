Charles Burton, Brock University. Rick Fisher, International Assessment and Strategy Center.\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€¦Google,and Twitter are blocked in mainland China, along with a host of major western news outlets. Searches for the term &quot;Panama Papers&quot; on major Chinese search engines like Baidu returned heavily filtered results accompanied with a customary notice displayed whenever a search deemed too sensitive or subversive is made: &quot;According to relevant laws and regulations, some of the search results are not shown&quot;.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe news, which broke early on Monday morning local time, took several hours to jump the language barrier. But as discussion on Chinese social media began to gather momentum, hundreds of offending posts were soon deleted and a topic page for the Panama Papers hashtag was censored. Searches for key terms and names linked to Chinese politicians were also blocked.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhile there are legitimate uses for shell companies registered in offshore tax havens, any insinuation of impropriety within Mr Xi's extended family could prove toxic given he has waged a far-reaching anti-corruption campaign to restore his party's credibility in the eyes of a Chinese public fed up with endemic graft. Discussion of the wealth of the party elite and their relatives is regarded as strictly off-limits by the Chinese leadershipâ€¦.â€\r\n \nhttp://www.smh.com.au/business/world-business/panama-papers-jump-chinese-language-barrier-get-suppressed-by-censors-20160404-gnydgr.html#ixzz456MrZ5UT","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:178222560ab3e37e049cc845fd716b329a99e3ad","amp;dn":"chinese-communist-party-panama-papers-daily-beast.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"178222560ab3e37e049cc845fd716b329a99e3ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,130,34,86,10,179,227,126,4,156,200,69,253,113,107,50,154,153,227,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
