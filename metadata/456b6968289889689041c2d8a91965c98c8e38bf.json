Angels earns its wings.&quot;\r\nâ€“Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\r\n\r\nMargaret Quinn lives alone, quietly mourning the disappearance of her only child, who fled ten years earlier to join a radical student group known as the Angels of Destruction.\r\n\r\nOn a cold winterâ€™s night, a nine-year-old girl arrives on Margaretâ€™s doorstep, claiming to be an orphan with no place to go. This child beguiles Margaret, and together they hatch a plan to pass her off as her newly found granddaughter, Norah Quinn.\r\n\r\nTheir conspiracy is made vulnerable by Norahâ€™s magical revelations to the children of the town, and by a lone figure shadowing the girl, who threatens to reveal the childâ€™s true identity and purpose. Who are these strangers really? And what is their connection to the past, the Angels, and Margaretâ€™s long-missing daughter?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:456b6968289889689041c2d8a91965c98c8e38bf","amp;dn":"Angels+of+Destruction+-+Keith+Donohue","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"456b6968289889689041c2d8a91965c98c8e38bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,107,105,104,40,152,137,104,144,65,194,216,169,25,101,201,140,142,56,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
