Kyle has always strived to make the show about expressing his own opinions instead of going with the crowd.

This was done to contrast the plethora of videos with some guy in his late 20's to early 40's ranting about recent videogame controversies and scandals.\r\n\r\nDue to the loyal following Kyle had created through The Final Bosman and the unfortunate closure of his video platform GameTrailers, I only find it fitting to archive his show, in the fear that most of his episodes (which are primarily uploaded to GameTrailers) will be deleted along with the website that hosted them","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:859d243d1a6afdf10393dd3ded17d1b10a83b84f","amp;dn":"The+Final+Bosman+%5BEp.+81-100%5D+WEBRip+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"859d243d1a6afdf10393dd3ded17d1b10a83b84f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,157,36,61,26,106,253,241,3,147,221,61,237,23,209,177,10,131,184,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
