Galactic Plague is a really challenging strategy for Android. Take side of alien invaders and attack earthlings with the game mechanics like in Plague or Pandemic. Only 10% of players may boast of complete levels. Test yourself. Fight against earthlings.\r\n\r\nX-Core. Galactic Plague is a real war. A space war depicting a clash of alien civilizations and earthlings. There have always been wars, but this war you will never forget. Like the plague, galaxy invaders will attack the earth and leave only a fallout wasteland after them. \r\nAliens are attacking as never before! Pathetic earthlings canâ€™t avoid the invasion. So they have to prepare their primitive weapons, missiles, tanks â€“ everything that can help them survive this clash.\r\n\r\nTen alien species are available to you:\r\n-Greys\r\n-Repriloids\r\n-Insectoids\r\n-Egyptian gods\r\n-Psychotrons\r\n-Biomorphes\r\n-Energy beings\r\n-Machines\r\n-Galaxy Council\r\n-USSR â€“ United Space Socialistic Republics\r\n\r\nMore than fifty strategic variants to invade the earth are available to you. Big upgrade trees enable you to evolve in the middle of your invasion company.\r\n\r\nAliens vs. Earthlings â€“ a banal theme for any movie, game, whether strategy or action. A banal theme turned upside down that will make you feel as a leader of an alien invasion army. Itâ€™s up to you how to proceed. X-files will not help earthlings, XCOM will not save earthlings. They will be either dead or enslaved.\r\n\r\nForward, my space general! Lead your army to victory! Be the plague, be the epidemic, evolve, kill, conquer!\r\n\r\nSupport X-CORE: (replace the 00 zeros to double o)\r\nFaceb00k:\nGoogle+ https://plus.google.com/communities/118131895337046348904\r\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/xcore_galactic_plague_official/\r\n\r\nWhatâ€™s new:\r\n- 3000 additional crystals\r\n- USSR opened\r\n- All mods are available for try\r\n\r\nMod Info:\r\nUnlimited money\r\n\r\nRequires Android OS 2.3.3 and up","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e3b85671685f31f15600662515352a5d6275464","amp;dn":"X-CORE+Galactic+Plague+Pro+v1.13+mod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e3b85671685f31f15600662515352a5d6275464","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,59,133,103,22,133,243,31,21,96,6,98,81,83,82,165,214,39,84,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
