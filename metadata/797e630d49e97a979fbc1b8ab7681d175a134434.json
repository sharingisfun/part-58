The Witcher is supposed to be a guardian of the innocent, a protector of those in need, a defender against powerful and dangerous monsters that prey on men in dark times.\r\n\r\nBut now that dark times have fallen upon the world, Geralt is helpless until he has recovered from his injuries.\r\n\r\nWhile war rages across all of the lands, the future of magic is under threat and those sorcerers who survive are determined to protect it. Itâ€™s an impossible situation in which to find one girlâ€”Ciri, the heiress to the throne of Cintra, has vanishedâ€”until a rumor places her in the Niflgaard court, preparing to marry the Emperor.\r\n\r\nInjured or not, Geralt has a rescue mission on his hands","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:797e630d49e97a979fbc1b8ab7681d175a134434","amp;dn":"Andrzej+Sapkowski+-+The+Witcher+3+-+Baptism+of+Fire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"797e630d49e97a979fbc1b8ab7681d175a134434","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,126,99,13,73,233,122,151,159,188,27,138,183,104,29,23,90,19,68,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
