Lakkis (Wiley-Blackwell, 2007).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-0-8138-2855-8\r\n\r\nIn Encapsulation and Controlled Release Technologies in Food Systems, editor Lakkis has gathered a highly respected collection of expert contributors from industry and academia to highlight recent innovations in encapsulation and controlled release technologies in food systems. Unlike most recent publications which dealt exclusively with theoretical aspects of these technologies, this volume focuses mainly on devising effective and innovative applications in food systems in which these delivery vehicles operate. In addition, the book provides some emphasis on new opportunities that may arise from the development of new materials for the design and fabrication of delivery vehicles and carriers.\r\n\r\nEncapsulation and Controlled Release Technologies gives the reader a solid grasp of basic concepts of encapsulation technologies and their novel applications in food systems. Dr. Lakkis also presents novel possibilities of encapsulation and controlled release along with a discussion on future perspectives and economical implications of these technologies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6da1c5a8d0c5381c0828c5f01f5aabb24f91aace","amp;dn":"Encapsulation+and+Controlled+Releasnologies+in+Food+System","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6da1c5a8d0c5381c0828c5f01f5aabb24f91aace","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,161,197,168,208,197,56,28,8,40,197,240,31,90,171,178,79,145,170,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
