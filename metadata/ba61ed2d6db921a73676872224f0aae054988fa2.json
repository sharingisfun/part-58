This version of Superman's adventures continue in Superman: Lois &amp; Clark, currently being published by DC.\r\n\r\nA remastered version of the Superman Post-Crisis Chronology found on various torrent sites. Rather than an unwieldy dump of thousands of issues that are meticulously numbered and ordered (and whose filenames screw with modern comic reader parsers), the Chronology is presented as a series of ad-hoc collections with a simple volume ordering. I'll be releasing these in series of 10 volumes a piece.\r\n\r\nAs with previous releases of this chronology, strict chronology order has been followed as close as possible, though some flexibility and &quot;grain of salt&quot; needs to be used for proper interpretation. Books have been culled from a variety of sources and all credit goes to the original scanners/rippers\r\n\r\nNow included in all releases is a copy of the Overview and Roadmap, outlining major events and acting as a starter's guide to Superman's adventures to help new readers find jumping-on points","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba61ed2d6db921a73676872224f0aae054988fa2","amp;dn":"Superman+Post-Crisis+Chronology%2C+Volumes+401-448","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba61ed2d6db921a73676872224f0aae054988fa2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,97,237,45,109,185,33,167,54,118,135,34,36,240,170,224,84,152,143,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
