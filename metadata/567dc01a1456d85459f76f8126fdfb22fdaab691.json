Liu (Wiley-Blackwell, 2014).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-118-35397-4\r\n\r\nWastes, whether they are solid wastes or wastewater, are resources from which economic values may be derived. Almost all components of agricultural and food wastewater can be and should be utilized or recovered; the stumbling block of achieving this aspiration is economical, not technical. The last one and a half decades have seen the surging of agricultural and non-agricultural commodity prices across the board and increased public consciousness of environmental impact of industrial wastewater discharge and treatment. The confluence of these new developments have generated new interests and applications of agricultural and food wastewater and their treatment residuals in diverse fields and industries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis new edition will expand topics related to wastewater utilizations and new uses of treatment residuals while providing up-to-date information on new treatment technologies and practices across the globe. The new editionâ€™s target audience is anyone who has the responsibility of dealing with its plant effluents in agricultural and food processing operations. It should be of value to waste management personnel responsible for managing major waste effluents from agro and food industries. It will also be useful for college students whose majors are in environmental science or waste management fields as a reference","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:567dc01a1456d85459f76f8126fdfb22fdaab691","amp;dn":"Food+and+Agricultural+Wastewater+Utilization+and+Treatment+2nd+e","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"567dc01a1456d85459f76f8126fdfb22fdaab691","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,125,192,26,20,86,216,84,89,247,111,129,38,253,251,34,253,170,182,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
