Cruz and Trump Ruffled. @monicacrowley. Fox News. Washington Times.\r\n\r\nâ€œAfter a triumphant night in Wisconsin, Ted Cruz paid the Bronx a visit, only to meet a host of unhappy people.\r\n\r\nâ€œTHE BRONX â€” A handful of Hasidic Jews, an Asian baby, two men in cowboy hats, a UCB performer and some protesters walked into a Chino-Latino restaurant. Oh, and Ted Cruz was there too.\r\n\r\nFresh off a major victory in Wisconsin on Tuesday night, the senator from Texas hosted a last-minute event billed as a â€œmeet and greet,â€ north of 149th street in the Bronx.

But he bailed. Leslie Palma, a spokesperson for Priests for Life, told The Daily Beast that Trump did not dial-in.\r\n\r\nâ€œA conservative operative with knowledge of the call told The Daily Beast that pro-life leaders involved were disappointed Trump decided not to speak with them.\r\n \nhttp://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/06/trump-blows-off-meeting-with-pro-life-leaders.html","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:787ed14cd774357eb61d9b5893ed3a3bffe8ef98","amp;dn":"johnbatchelor-monicacrowley-cruz-trump-ny.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"787ed14cd774357eb61d9b5893ed3a3bffe8ef98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,126,209,76,215,116,53,126,182,29,155,88,147,237,58,59,255,232,239,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
