I just went through over 8000 public domain videos!!!!\r\nYeah you heard me right. This film is in black and white. Sorry color. Now if you like the music of Pink Floyd, you might like this film. I personally don't like Pink Floyd or any sellout in the music industry. I was going to apply my film to the academy awards, but guess what? You have to sell the film you are applying for. NO THANKS! This film is best described as Pink Floyd meets the film A Man With a Movie Camera. \r\n\r\nThis film could have been in the Hidden Gem category, but then it wouldn't be hidden.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere are the photos. Various resolution for the photos. Don't worry, the film picture has the right resolution. I think one video I used might have been 720 quality, the rest were 1080.\r\n\r\nShort Film made by me.
