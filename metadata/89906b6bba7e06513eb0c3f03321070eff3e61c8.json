I share because I want to give back to the community that has given to me for years. I believe torrents are a great form or advertising and promoting. When people can test games and watch movies before buying them they are more likely to support the developers / producers by buying their products.\r\n\r\nI Try to release things no one else has so when people steal my torrents without saying thanks or giving recognition it makes me want to stop. So if you want to share my stuff please ask or mention me.\r\n\r\nPlease don't hit and run show some appreciation and say thanks/seed so you motivate me to keep sharing things that no one else has. My motivation is to give to the community but if your not telling me you like it I feel i'm wasting my time. I have lots of stuff no one else has shared but i'm not going to put much time into it unless people seed and say thanks. -TheDarkKnight\r\n\r\n\r\n!!!IF YOU LIKE THIS PLEASE SUPPORT THE DEVELOPERS AND BUY IT!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89906b6bba7e06513eb0c3f03321070eff3e61c8","amp;dn":"Jet+Car+Stunts+-+TheDarkKnight","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89906b6bba7e06513eb0c3f03321070eff3e61c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,144,107,107,186,126,6,81,62,176,195,240,51,33,7,14,255,62,97,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
