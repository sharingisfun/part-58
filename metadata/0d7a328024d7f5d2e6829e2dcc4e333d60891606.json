I recorded this off TV in Germany. All 5 videos in this torrent.\r\n\r\nmp4 format \r\n\r\n720 x 540 format\r\n\r\neach video @ 1:20:00 min.\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nJust 6 hours of a train slowing moving through Norway. Feel the excitement. \r\n\r\nNot HD! This was recorded in the cab by a video recorder, through the window of the cab, so if you're used to HD, you won't find it here. There are dead bugs and crap on the windows, for example. Again!!! Donâ€™t leave asshole comments about how the video isnâ€™t clear or HD, this was recorded years ago, shot from a camera behind glass on a train!\r\n\r\nNo music, just the sound of the train and engineer/radio, etc.\r\n\r\nScreenshots: http://imgur.com/a/K1rIi \r\n\r\nCheck my account for other train videos like this, many more to come","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d7a328024d7f5d2e6829e2dcc4e333d60891606","amp;dn":"Driver%27s-Eye+View+-+Norway+-+Oslo+to+Bergen+-+5+videos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d7a328024d7f5d2e6829e2dcc4e333d60891606","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,122,50,128,36,215,245,210,230,130,158,45,204,78,51,61,96,137,22,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
