But these aren't your typical songs of worship...each song is infused with unique instruments and ever-changing musical styles that inject new, often unexpected life into each of the tracks.\r\n\r\nBut even the most hardened traditionalists needn't worry: the vocal melodies remain unchanged, ensuring that you can immediately sing along to your favorite hymns right out of the gate.  The end result is a musical odyssey that manages to strike the tough balance of experimenting with the form, while still staying true to the spirit of the originals.\r\n\r\nAlso refreshing is its minimalist approach: the raw sound keeps everything simple and coherent, without overwhelming the songs with unnecessary extras. In other words, it will remind you of the little church in a small town, where it's all about the message, rather than the warehouse-sized churches of the city today, where large congregations and televised sermons focus on how to maximize donations and profits.  And isn't that what religion should be all about?\r\n\r\nTRACK LISTING:\r\n1.) Amazing Grace\r\n2.) I'll Fly Away +\r\n3.) A Mighty Fortress is Our God\r\n4.) Leaning on the Everlasting Arms\r\n5.)
