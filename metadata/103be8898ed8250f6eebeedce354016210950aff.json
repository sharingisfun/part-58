It strayed further from the source material than they were comfortable, he split the story into 3, when the book more naturally divided into 2, and where did that albino orc come from?\r\n\r\nNonetheless, they were some smashing movies that led naturally into one another and told a coherent story. So I took all three films and edited them into a single 5-and-a-half hour movie.\r\n\r\nIf you like this kind of thing, I did the same for Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy here: \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/13813408/Lord_of_the_Rings_Complete_[Extended_Edition]_DVDRIP\r\n\r\nAnd with the Back to the Future trilogy here: \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11281467/Back_to_the_Future_-_The_Movie\r\n\r\nand with the Star Trek 2-3-4 series here: \nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/11672069/Star_Trek_-_The_Genesis_Affair\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:103be8898ed8250f6eebeedce354016210950aff","amp;dn":"The+Hobbit+All-in-One","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"103be8898ed8250f6eebeedce354016210950aff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,59,232,137,142,216,37,15,110,235,238,220,227,84,1,98,16,149,10,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
