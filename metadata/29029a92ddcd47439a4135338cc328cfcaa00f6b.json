Brian BlasÃ©, Mercatus Center, George Mason University.\r\n\r\nJohn Batchelor April 8,2016\r\n\r\nMedicaid enrollment exploded for two main reasons: more people qualifying for the program because of expanded eligibility and funding under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and the weak economic recoveryâ€”a contributing factor to which is the ACA. The weak economy has been especially painful for lower-skilled individuals. According to a March 2016 report from CBO, â€œearnings from wages and salaries are now expected to grow more slowly for lower-income peopleâ€¦result[ing] in an increased share of the population eligible for Medicaid.â€ While CBOâ€™s estimates are forward-looking, the economy and the number of workers have grown significantly slower than CBO projected back in 2010 when the ACA became law. In fact, the economy is about 7% smaller this year than CBO projected it would be in 2010.\r\n\r\nTo date, 30 states have adopted the ACA expansion, which primarily covers working-age, non-disabled adults up to 138% of the federal poverty level ($16,243 in 2015). According to CBO, 12 million more people were enrolled in Medicaid in 2015 due to the ACA expansion.\r\n\r\nThe federal government provides a 100% reimbursement of the cost of Medicaid expansion enrollees from 2014 through 2016. A 100% reimbursement incentivizes states to spend freely on expansion enrollees, which appears to have happened as Medicaid expansion enrollees are costing far more than was expected. According to the 2014 Actuarial Report on the Financial Outlook for the Medicaid program:\r\n\r\nâ€œNewly eligible adults are estimated to have had average benefit costs of $5,517 in 2014, 19 percent greater than non-newly eligible adultsâ€™ average benefit costs of $4,650. These estimates are significantly different from those in previous reports, in which average benefit costs for newly-eligible adults in 2014 were estimated to be 1 percent lower than those of non-newly eligible adults.â€\r\n \nhttp://mercatus.org/expert_commentary/medicaid-not-big-enough-administration-proposes-100-billion-more-spending","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29029a92ddcd47439a4135338cc328cfcaa00f6b","amp;dn":"John+Batchelor-aca-medicaid-plus-fails--patient.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29029a92ddcd47439a4135338cc328cfcaa00f6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,2,154,146,221,205,71,67,154,65,53,51,140,195,40,207,202,160,15,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
