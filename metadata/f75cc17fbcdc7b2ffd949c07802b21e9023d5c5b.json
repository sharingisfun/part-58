L. Guthrie (OUP, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978â€“0â€“19â€“872984â€“6\r\n\r\nVolume 2 considers the essential conditions for a model to be truly predictive. The authors use a statistical approach to rate the validity of the various predictive models that have been previously used for evaluating various thermophysical properties. On the basis of this assessment, the authors have predicted values for the thermophysical properties of elemental metallic liquids, which are lacking in experimental data. They believe their predicted values are at least as reliable, and sometimes more reliable than corresponding experimental values. According to the periodic law, the authors provide the periodic variations in values of some twelve physical quantities or thermophysical properties. This is based on the electron configuration in the outermost energy level of metallic elements. Finally, a large number of experimental data for the physical quantities and thermophysical properties of liquid metallic elements are compiled","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f75cc17fbcdc7b2ffd949c07802b21e9023d5c5b","amp;dn":"The+Thermophysical+Properties+of+Metallic+Liquids%2C+Volume+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f75cc17fbcdc7b2ffd949c07802b21e9023d5c5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,92,193,127,188,220,123,47,253,148,156,7,128,43,33,233,2,61,92,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
