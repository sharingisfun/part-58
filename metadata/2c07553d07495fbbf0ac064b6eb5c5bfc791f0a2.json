Davy Crockett\r\nKing of the Wild Frontier!\r\n\r\nDescribing the significance of Davy Crockett is a daunting task. Itâ€™s both a historical event and a pop-culture phenomenon that defined the childhood of an entire generation of people. Though not having been there myself, I imagine it mustâ€™ve been very much comparable to the crazes that I went through as a young kid, whether it was Jurassic Park, Star Wars, or The Lion King. But from seeing archival footage and hearing eyewitnesses talk, it even appears to have been much bigger than those.\r\n\r\nDespite the â€œKing of the Wild Frontierâ€ not holding any memories of my young life, as it does for others, I still have great affection for the series. I find the show incredibly fun to watch, which I chock up to the characters.\r\nThey may not be entirely accurate historical representations of their real-life counterparts, but I couldn't care less. Davy makes a great hero figure, and his sidekick George Russel is a very likeable guy. They have great personalities with genuine warmth, and I find it easy to care for them. Their friendship is touching, especially when it culminates to an instance in the third episode which becomes fairy emotional.\r\n\r\nAdding to the enjoyment is the feeling of stepping back in time in our nationâ€™s history. Whenever I watch Davy Crockett, I feel like Iâ€™ve time-traveled back to the 1950â€™s and have gotten a glimpse of what it was like for kids back then. The only would-be negative effects coming from the 50â€™s aura is a layer of cheesiness. These certainly arenâ€™t the most realistic pieces of television by any stretch of the imagination, and much of the violence comes off as being â€œfakeâ€ by todayâ€™s standards. Yet, even for a 16-year-old who has grown up with the special effects of this and the last decade, it doesnâ€™t tarnish my admiration of the series one bit. \r\n\r\n.: Locandina :.\r\n\r\n[img]https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4d/Davy_Crockett,_King_of_the_Wild_Frontier_FilmPoster.jpeg[/img]\r\n\r\n.: Crediti :.\r\n\r\nFess Parker (Davy Crockett)\r\nBuddy Ebsen (George Russel)\r\nBasil Ruysdael (Andrew Jackson)\r\nWilliam Bakewell (Tobias Norton)\r\nHelene Stanley (Polly Crockett)\r\nPat Hogan (Redstick)\r\nEugene Brindel (Billy)\r\nRay Whitetree (Johnny)\r\nMike Mazurki (Big Foot Mason)\r\nJeff Thompson (Two Shirts)\r\nHans Conreid (Thimberleig)\r\nKenneth Tobey (Jim Bowie/Jocko)\r\nNick Cravat (Bustedluck)\r\nJeff York (Mike Fink)\r\nWalter Catlett (Colonel Plug)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c07553d07495fbbf0ac064b6eb5c5bfc791f0a2","amp;dn":"Davy+Crockett+S01e01-03+%28Complete%29+1954+%5B2+DVD5+Eng%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c07553d07495fbbf0ac064b6eb5c5bfc791f0a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,7,85,61,7,73,95,187,240,172,6,75,110,181,197,191,199,145,240,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
