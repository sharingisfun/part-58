When the elevator (box) doors open, he is pulled\r\ninto a glade - with few trees and a wide open plain surrounded by thin forests\r\nby a group of teenage boys who also have no memories besides their name\r\n\r\nThomas gradually discovers that the Glade is run by two boys: Alby, the leader\r\nand Newt, the second-in-charge, who both maintain order by enforcing strict rules\r\nThe elevator box surfaces the ground once every month to supply new food, sometimes\r\nweapons, and always a new boy. The Glade is surrounded squarely by a mile-high wall\r\nmade of concrete. Outside the wall is the Maze, a labyrinth of high concrete walls\r\ncovered in ivy. The Maze houses strange, lethal creatures known as Grievers.\r\nGrievers are described as monsters of metal and flesh. The Gladers are trying to stay\r\nalive as well as &quot;solve&quot; the Maze by running through it as fast as they can while\r\ntracking movements of the walls and trying to find an exit to escape. Every month\r\nthe box is sent up with a new person called a &quot;greenie&quot; and every two weeks supplies\r\nare sent.\r\n\r\nBox Office\r\n\r\nBudget: $34,000,000 (estimated)\r\nOpening Weekend: $32,512,804 (USA) (19 September 2014)\r\nGross: $102,413,606 (USA) (23 January 2015)\r\nWorldwide: $348,319,861 (worldwide) / $245,891,999 (Non-USA)\r\nFilming Dates: 6 May 2013 - 1 July 2013\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that all screenshot was captured at 1080p, resized to 720p\r\nand then compressed using PNG to improve the loading time.\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/25361075088355744678.png  \r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/32294247796979514881.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/11390786898740193090.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/01245670969795864672.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/45126169989635598652.png  \r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/31140653502971505308.png\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt1790864/\r\n\r\n:: General ::\r\n\r\nFormat: Matroska/MKV\r\nFile Size: 9.48 GiB\r\nOverall Bit Rate: 12.0 Mbps\r\nFormat profile:   \r\nDuration: 01:53:26\r\nSample: Yes\r\nSubtitles: English\r\nChapters: Yes\r\nEncoded By oneanight\r\n\r\n:: Video Info ::\r\n\r\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\r\nWriting library: x264\r\nVideo bitrate: 10 MB\r\nResolution: 1920 X 800 pixels\r\nAspect ratio(AR): 2.40:1\r\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\r\n\r\n:: Audio Info ::\r\n\r\nFormat profile: DTS / AC3\r\nAudio Bit rate 1: 1509 Kbps\r\nAudio Bit rate 2: 448 Kbps Kbps\r\nCompression mode: Lossy/Lossy\r\nBit rate mode Constant/Constant\r\nAudio Language: English\r\nSampling rate: 48.0 KHz Bit depth 24 bits/48.0 KHz\r\nChannel positions: Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nChannels:1 &amp; 2 6 channels 5.1 Surround\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5445a1eb8778c9d13c7e15540e0e26f2a99b55b7","amp;dn":"Maze+Runner+-+%5B2014%5D+1080p+BDRip+x264+DTS+AC3+%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5445a1eb8778c9d13c7e15540e0e26f2a99b55b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,69,161,235,135,120,201,209,60,126,21,84,14,14,38,242,169,155,85,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
