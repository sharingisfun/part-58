Mary Kissel, Wall Street Journal Editorial Board &amp; host of Opinion Journal on WSJ Video. Francis Rose, WMAL.\r\n\r\n&quot;President Obama chooses his words carefully, so it was startling on Sunday when he chose to opine on the Justice Departmentâ€™s investigation into Hillary Clinton â€™s private email server.
