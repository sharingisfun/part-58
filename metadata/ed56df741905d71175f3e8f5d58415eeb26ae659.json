I have no knowledge of cracking, so hopefully one of you may be able to crack it, and don't have to spend the pricey price tag. \r\n\r\nAgain, this isn't cracked. What happens is you run the installer, it installs to your computer, and once DeskPilot is first launched, it will ask for a serial.\r\n\r\n6 characters either numbers/letters in each string, and there are 5 strings. Like this:\r\n\r\nxxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxx\r\n\r\n\r\nAny virus indications are false positives, if you get one. I haven't gotten an indication, but if you do, it's a false positive","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed56df741905d71175f3e8f5d58415eeb26ae659","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%5D+DeskPilot+Professional+%2ANOT+CRACKED%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed56df741905d71175f3e8f5d58415eeb26ae659","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,86,223,116,25,5,215,17,117,243,232,245,213,132,21,238,178,106,230,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
